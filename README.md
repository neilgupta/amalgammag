Amalgam Magazine was an online magazine I created with a friend about six years ago, while in high school. This repositary is a backup of the custom content management system I created back then for the site. You can see the site in action at **[amalgammag.metamorphium.com](http://amalgammag.metamorphium.com)**.

Note: This code is offered as-is with no guarantees. It was written in 2006, while I was still a sophomore in high school, and has not been looked at since.
