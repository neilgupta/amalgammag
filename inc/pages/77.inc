<p>Google - we hear that name on a daily basis. Whether it be the phrase "Just Google it!" to "Yeah, blah@gmail.com," we\'re exposed to this company more often than we even notice. Lately, Google\'s seemed to take over our lives, and that\'s not necessarily a good thing. After all, a company can\'t be all good, right? "It\'s extremely useful, but I\'ll reserve judgment on whether it upholds \'Don\'t be evil," (the Google motto)" says Googler Aneesh Goel.</p>

<h12>The Cons of Google</h12>
<p>Neil Gupta</p>

<p>When I first heard about the idea behind Amalgam, the first thing I did was "google" it to see what else was out there by that name. (Yes, I know that\'s pathetic, but I\'m trying to prove a point here, so bear with me). Google has become an indispensable source of information that is quickly replacing the need for anything else. Whenever there is a question, a common response is to "<a href="http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com/">just \'google\' it</a>." Considered a <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/news/ebusinessnews/wpn-45-20040504GoogleFindsReligion.html">religion by some</a>, an essential tool by many, and feared by others, it has caught the attention and envy of all.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="inc/MSfiles/77.jpg" /></p>

<p>Google quickly rose from a small, start-up search engine to a colossal, multi-faceted corporation (one of the largest in the U.S., with over $6.1 billion in sales last year), which now offers various products and services in almost every aspect of one\'s online life. Part of the reason behind this rapid growth was the positive reputation it had picked up with its motto "Do no evil." Google\'s policy has always been to take the more "useful" option, not necessarily the more profitable one. However, as of late, Google has been treading a forbidden path of crime and murder. (Well maybe not murder...)</p>

<p>Crime? What crime could Google, our technological savior, possibly have committed? Well, the <a href="http://www.fuckedgoogle.com/">list goes on</a> and <a href="http://google-watch.org/">on</a>, but, admittedly, I couldn\'t care less about most of the "crimes" these sites accuse Google of. In reality, there are two major problems with Google that concern the average consumer: censorship and privacy.</p>

<p>First, let\'s begin with censorship:</p>

<p>When the Chinese government blocked off access to Google from China altogether, Google was quick to offer to censor its results, replacing any possible anti-government propaganda with pre-approved sites, in order to return access to the Chinese citizens. This political move caused an immediate uproar amongst US citizens as Google took an "unpatriotic" stance to aid the communist government, resulting in Google being called to a Congressional meeting regarding the matter.</p>

<p>"Pfft." That\'s the response I got from one person when told that Google censoring results for China is a problem. No follow up. No reasons why it\'s not a problem. No words at all. Just an air of complete disinterest for the problems of some country on the other side of the planet. But it becomes a problem for us when Google not only censors China, but also begins to censor the web from all.</p>

<p>Don\'t believe me? Google recently <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/27/google_doesnt_censor/">revised</a> their FAQ article on censorship, which originally read, "Google does not censor results for any search term. [. . .] We believe strongly in the democracy of the web." It now reads that it will censor as needed, thereby admitting that they do indeed censor the web. However, it\'s not just China that gets to be censored. You might be surprised to learn that Google is censoring content right here within the United States. Several <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2053731645001034711">videos of bombs detonating in Iraq</a> that are hosted on the Google Video service originally presented the error, "This video is not playable in your country." However, in light of the recent heat caused by the China censorship, Google has changed this message to read, "We\'re sorry, but the provider of this video has not authorized Google to display this video in your location." Theoretically, changing your location in the settings page should give you access to the video. However, I tried setting it to various different countries, from the more common western nations to the most obscure places I had never even heard of, but to no avail. Apparently, no country had been authorized to view this video. At least it doesn\'t sound like censorship anymore.</p>

<p>Another major topic regarding Google that has been circulating around the news media recently is privacy issues concerning Google\'s immense database of user information. Google has records of almost everything about you. They have your personal information (name, address, phone number, and social security number, among other things, are all required when signing up for many Google programs, such as AdSense), they have your entire search history from the day of Google\'s conception (they know what you like and what you\'re interested in, maybe even better than you yourself do), and they host your email (they know who you talk to and what you talk about), This gold mine of personal data would be like the "information Wal-Mart" for our <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/19/bush/">prying government</a>, which has already proven that it has no regard for the privacy or rights of its citizens.</p>

<p>Google claims that it does not read any of this information, nor does it sell it to third parties. It apparently only uses the data to improve its services. Of course, we have no choice but to believe them. However, it is extremely easy for Google, the government, or even a hacker to get access to this sensitive data.</p>

<p>And it seems that our government has lost no time in  <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/01/21/google_subpoena_roils_the_web/">trying to gain access</a> into Google\'s databases, a move which Google has fought in order to defend the privacy of its users. But with Yahoo!, MSN, Alta Vista, and other search engines already caving into the government\'s demands, how much longer can Google stay standing? A judge recently ruled that Google would have to hand over a random sample of search queries, but this data did not have to contain anything identifying a user. Of course, the government will only become braver next time.</p>

<p>Google\'s release of Google Desktop 3 only increased fears of privacy concerns as version 3.0 added a new feature called Searching-Across-Computers (SAC), which provides the user with the option to sync the index of his or her hard drive contents with Google\'s servers, thereby allowing the user to access that index and search the original computer from anywhere with a web connection. This <a href="http://www.securitypipeline.com/shared/article/printablePipelineArticle.jhtml?articleId=180204275">poses a colossal security threat</a> because anyone with access to the Google server can see into everything on your hard drive. What more could the government ask for? Every security analyst agrees that Google Desktop\'s <a href="http://blog.eweek.com/blogs/intermedia/archive/2006/02/10/5847.aspx">SAC feature should not be used</a> under any circumstances.</p>

<p>Google Desktop is only one example of where privacy concerns crop up, and probably the largest source of these concerns, but almost every product and service from Google poses these privacy threats. Everything from Gmail, where every email, even the ones that you delete, are stored on the server for an indefinite period of time, to Search History, which proves that every search you have ever visited is readily available to Google.</p>

<p>When presented with the topic of privacy concerns and issues, a Google employee answered that privacy issues are not unique to Google, but are a problem for the entire industry. Although privacy concerns are indeed an issue for every company in every industry, the concerns are greatly heightened when dealing with Google because of the vast amount of sensitive data Google possesses, as I\'ve already described above.</p>

<p>Now, let\'s assume for a moment that Google does manage to hold back the US government from gaining access to any more data. We are also trusting Google to not sell all of this data to third parties, which can be very tempting, considering the amount of money that can be made from such a move. Even if those assumptions are made, Google is a company run by humans and guarded by humans. Theoretically, a hacker could remotely break into the server and harvest all of the data stored internally. Granted that Google\'s security is probably the best available, it does not make it unbeatable.</p>

<p>But of course, that was all a hypothetical situation. The government will most likely have acquired all of the data within Google long before any hacker manages to break in. As for what happens when the government does finally manage to pull those search logs out of Google, does anyone here actually believe that Bush\'s intent is to fight child pornography? If I were you, I would quickly start <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,70168-0.html?tw=wn_index_22">spinning suspicious searches</a> into harmless research.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many other problems that plague Google, such as click fraud and several law suits claiming that it is biased in search result placement, placing commercial sites that offer advertising money before others. Another problem that many complain about is its opt-out policy, rather than opt-in. Most companies will offer a service and allow people to chose if they wish to use it or not. Google, on the other hand, will create a service and will automatically force people into it, where the only way out is to write to Google and request to be removed from the program. One example is the Google Book Search service, which proposed to scan hundreds of books into its database and provide them for people to search. Of course, this raised copyright concerns that were ignored for the most part. Google used the opt-out approach and decided it would scan all books, unless it received a request by the author to be taken out of the service for each book that he or she did not want scanned.</p>

<p>Every company has its skeletons in the company closet. However, these skeletons become a problem when they compromise customer privacy and rights, both of which Google is indeed greatly threatening.</p>

<p>I\'m not advocating that we stop using Google altogether. It is an excellent tool, as I use it everyday and could not imagine living without it. My intention is not to create distrust in Google, but instead to raise awareness that Google is nowhere close to being the perfect company many people view it as. Next time you type in www.google.com into your browser, think about what I\'ve just mentioned above before entering your search query. Keeping that in mind, I leave you with "Happy Google-ing!" (Now we just need to make "Amalgam-ing" a verb.)</p>

<h12>Pros of Google</h12>
<p>Ruchi Srivastava</p>

<p>	But no one can say Google\'s all negative - in fact, it might be the best thing that\'s ever happened to the internet! From GoogleTalk to the original search engine. Google has helped people throughout the world with communication and information.</p>
<p>	Instead of going through all the Google products one by one (which would take forever), I\'ll just highlight a few, the ones we commonly use;  Google Web Search, Google Image Search, and Gmail. </p>
<p>	Google Web Search - the thing that started Google. I don\'t know a single person, my four year old cousins included, who have not used this at one point in time; the modern teen uses it for research projects as well as minor things such as finding lyrics to that totally awesome song playing on the radio and the older people use it for basically everything.  Yes, sometimes the sites that come up are irrelevant or inaccurate....but, can you blame Google? If anything, this is beneficial to us as researchers - we learn to cross reference all our sources and this, in the end, ensures that we actually retain what we set out to research. Yes, people do post inaccurate facts and articles, but that\'s just one of the dangers of searching on the internet rather than in a book. When we use any type of search engine, that risk is there. That\'s not exactly a Google specific problem - if you\'re going to harp on that, why are you using internet at all?</p>
	<p>Aside from Google Web Search, I don\'t know anyone who\'s not, at one point in time, use Google Image Search. Whether it\'s for desktop backgrounds or an English project, most people have taken the time to go to images.google.com and type in a query. Admittedly, sometimes you do get incorrect or inappropriate images, but, once again, you cannot blame the search engine; the internet is the internet, and it\'s far from infallible. People post their pictures and you access them under certain words - it\'s not Google error, but human stupidity. If anything, the blame falls on the searcher for not being specific enough with search keywords.</p>
<p>	Probably the most recent thing Google has released that hit the big scale (because, in my opinion, GoogleTalk wasn\'t completely successful) is Gmail. For those of you who have a Gmail account, you realize how useful Gmail really is as compared to other email providers. If you send out an email, all the responses get archived in such a way that your inbox isn\'t flooded with hundreds of separate emails that give you a headache when you try to sort through them. Also, unlike most of the other email providers (Yahoo and MSN), Gmail started out with giving you unlimited space (pretty much) in your inbox; you had to pay for space in Yahoo and MSN until recently. Another feature of Gmail which was recently added is the GoogleTalk bar on the side. If I receive an email from someone else using Gmail, I can contact them immediately through IM rather then sending an email back and forth; this allows for efficiency, something most people in today\'s world strive for (note: Gmail is rather hard to explain unless you\'ve actually seen the setup).</p>
	<p>Despite having all these positives, I\'m not saying that Google is perfect; in fact, it\'s far from being so. Google Desktop is an easy way for people to install software that you most likely don\'t want onto your computer.  Actually, Google itself seems threatening to one\'s privacy; with its vast archives and use, a government official who wants to get information on someone\'s life only has to ask the company for records of that person. Also, you can just search a person - the fact that one\'s life is on public access is somewhat scary.</p>
<p>	Google, however, does not distribute these records - in fact, most of the time your records stay private; if Google needs input on what they are doing wrong and what people like to see, they have a different way of finding it out: conventions. "During the February break I went to a Google user meeting for teens and they are going to make an avatar world... it\'s like AIM except you have an avatar and you can do motions and stuff...and I like the company and I like how they are being innovative and do new things," says Stephanie Syu. Rather than invading people\'s privacy, Google holds meetings and conventions filled with fun in order to obtain their information.</p>
<p>	Once again, I\'m not saying Google is perfect; they admit to using some of the archives to see what people like. But, once again, this is an internet problem, not a Google-specific problem. If you don\'t like that a company can see what you do on the internet, then don\'t use it at all. No matter what, once you enter your information, people can track you.</p>
<p>	Privacy issues, the one big fault that people target with Google, is not (repeat: not) only a Google problem. I don\'t think I need to reiterate that it is in fact an internet issue. If you use Yahoo, Dogpile, or MSN search you get the exact same results with the same amount, if not more, risk. Google has proved itself to be worthy of our trust by not giving records to the US government when asked. What reason do we have not to trust it?</p>
<p>	Also, there is a team of lawyers out in Google watching these same privacy issues; I know other companies do this as well. If you\'re going to fault Google, I suggest you also bash Microsoft, Yahoo, and any other company that has both a search engine and email provider that allows them to track your progress.</p>
	<p>Google itself is a beneficial company. Several kids find it so: "I love Google," says Natalie So. It\'s a simple statement that reflects many people\'s attitudes towards to the company. And why not? "It\'s the first page that pops up and it\'s easy to load and simple," Jasmyn Johal said when I asked why she liked Google so much. </p>
<p>	"It\'s pretty useful. And really nice," Josh Geller said when I asked him what he thought about Google. And Sarah Fingerhood agreed, saying "It\'s fast and convenient." And that\'s what Google has become to us, a convenience.</p>
<p>	What\'s the point of bashing something that does us so much good for something it can\'t exactly help? If you don\'t trust the company, then don\'t use it. However, don\'t be one of the hypocrites who uses Google constantly, has a Gmail account, and still says "Google is evil." Frankly, if you believed that, you wouldn\'t be using the search engine and you\'d delete your email account.</p>
<p>	There are some components to Google that seem a bit fishy; mainly, the Google Desktop search. However, these are optional packages that you don\'t even have to touch. There seems to be no harm to the Google search as far as I can see - and once again, if you have issues with privacy, I suggest you just don\'t use the internet.</p>

<p>	So, Google does have its good and bad sides. After all, it\'s a company; you can\'t expect it to be perfect. But does the bad outweigh the good? Or does the good triumph? You\'ve seen both the pros and cons of Google... what do you think? Do they live up to their motto: "Don\'t be evil?"</p>
