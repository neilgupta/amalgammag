<p><b>Intro</b></p>
<p>It's no secret that Windows, to put it bluntly, sucks.  For half a decade, PC users have grown continually sick of watching their Mac counterparts rattle away the many advantages of using Macs over PC's. The sad part is that as of right now, Macs are indeed outperforming PC's in almost every regard. From security to processing to physical appearance, Macs have PC's beat.  This is not helped by the fact that Apple has released 4 versions of their Mac OS X while Microsoft has not updated their OS in about half a decade.</p>
<p>But wait. There's still hope for Windows users; Microsoft's next planned OS release, Windows Vista, may very well be on par with its Mac counterpart (which on release, will probably be Mac OS X Leopard, if release dates remain as they are).</p>
<p>So now we're all asking: why has it taken them so long? Compared to Apple's consistent OS release dates, Microsoft has been lagging behind horribly. However, we have to consider that a big thing at Microsoft is backwards compatibility. With all the millions of applications created for Windows, Microsoft has to make sure that all of them still work in the next OS (while still creating innovative ways to improve their system). Apple, on the other hand, has chosen to stop supporting applications as needed, which may very well be in their favor. Then, there's the fact that Microsoft's next planned release, Windows Vista, is supposed to be a completely revolutionary OS that will \"the change the way computing works.\" While I (and most other people) find this slightly hard to believe, it is hard to ignore the fact that, judging from the test builds that have been released to beta testers in the Microsoft community (including the recent Beta 2, which was released to the public), much has changed (for the better) since Windows XP.</p>
<p>In this article, I will chronicle my experience with Windows Vista Beta 2 and comment on its many new features.</p>

<p><b>Graphical Interface</b></p>
<a href=\"inc/MSfiles/142/aero.png\" title=\"Vista Aero Desktop\"><img class=\"left\" src=\"inc/MSfiles/142/aeroSmall.png\" alt=\"Vista Aero Desktop\" /></a>

<p>The most obvious difference is the new graphical interface, called Aero. Aero sports \"glass effects,\" which makes the title bar at the top (as well as the start bar) appear slightly transparent, blurring everything behind it. Many people have said the transparency is overdone, and I agree with this to a certain extent. It seems that Microsoft had just discovered transparency, decided it was cool, and made everything transparent. But then I have to admit, it does look cool. It has a few problems though. As you can see in the above screenshot, Windows Media Player has a ton of glass. This makes the text on the glass extremely hard to read.</p>
<p>Aero is possible because it utilizes the graphics card for windows rendering. Thus, many old problems with window-drawing are gone. For example, windows no longer tear or lag while you're dragging them around. Windows have traditionally been re-drawn as they are brought into focus, but now, a copy of each window's output is saved into memory, so that if the application at the top starts malfunctioning, it will not start erasing the window behind it. Aero also reduces system crashes that result from graphics driver problems.</p>
<a href=\"inc/MSfiles/142/start_menu.png\" title=\"Vista's new Start menu\"><img class=\"right\" src=\"inc/MSfiles/142/start_menuSmall.png\" alt=\"Vista's new Start menu\" /></a>
<p>One of the main focuses of Vista is making everything look more streamlined and easy to find, and I think Microsoft has done a decent job of making improvements from Windows XP. The \"start\" text on the start button has been removed, and the start button now consists of a circular windows logo. Also, pulling up the start menu yields a single menu; cascading menus have been removed (and I say good riddance).</p>
<a href=\"inc/MSfiles/142/alt_tab.png\" title=\"Alt-Tab Preview\"><img class=\"left\" src=\"inc/MSfiles/142/alt_tabSmall.png\" alt=\"Alt-Tab Preview\" /></a>

<p>Windows Vista will also provide new, more efficient ways to switch windows. In XP, one would switch windows by pressing alt + tab. By holding that key combination, users see a set of icons that corresponds to the applications users can switch to. But what happens when you have 10 Internet Explorer windows open? (Note: I do not support/use IE, but apparently most PC users use it.) The assumption is that you are not some kind of genius with photographic memory who will memorize the contents of all of the windows. Vista alleviates this problem by having alt + tab show a thumbnail of the window instead of an icon. Microsoft has also introduced a completely new way of switching windows called Flip 3D, activated by pressing the windows key + tab, which allows users to display windows in a 3D plane, giving users instant information about the window's contents.</p>
<a href=\"inc/MSfiles/142/flip_3d.png\" title=\"Vista Flip 3D Preview\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"inc/MSfiles/142/flip_3dSmall.png\" alt=\"Vista Flip 3D Preview\" /></a>

<p>As an alternative to window switching, you can also mouse over the application in the task bar, which will bring up a \"live\" thumbnail of the window without having to bring the window into focus.</p>
<a href=\"inc/MSfiles/142/live_thumbnails.png\" title=\"Vista Live Thumbnails Preview\"><img class=\"left\" src=\"inc/MSfiles/142/live_thumbnailsSmall.png\" alt=\"Vista Live Thumbnails Preview\" /></a>
<p>Why is this so important? While, according to a recent survey, the average PC user will use only about 4 windows at a time, power users, who can use upwards of 20 windows, will be thankful for the increased productivity that will result from these new window-switching methods.</p>
<p>In the event that you don't like the new glass effects (many have said that it is hard on the eyes), you can use the Windows Classic theme, which comes with Vista, reminiscent of the Windows 98. This will also disable the cool Flip 3D feature, however, and you won't get the benefits of having the graphics card render the windows.</p>
<a href=\"inc/MSfiles/142/classic.png\" title=\"Vista in Classic mode\"><img class=\"right\" src=\"inc/MSfiles/142/classicSmall.png\" alt=\"Vista in Classic mode\" /></a>
<p>I find a few things wrong with Aero that really annoy me right now. The sad thing about Aero is that java applications cannot be rendered using glass. This results in Vista automatically disabling the glass effects \"temporarily.\" Of course, this is somewhat of a lie, since the last time I rebooted after using a java application, it was still using the Vista Basic theme, which is a cooler-looking Windows XP theme. While trying to find a way to re-enable Aero, I found that the computer was operating a lot slower, lagging at every turn. Also, on a laptop, Vista disabled the glass effects when I was running on its \"power-saving mode.\" This is something that laptop-users may want to watch out for, as having Aero disabled lags the computer a lot (except if you're using the Windows Classic theme).</p>

<p><b>Search Features</b></p>
<p>Search has been integrated into Windows like never before. You can search from almost every window and Windows interface in general, including the start menu. That should cut down a lot of time navigating those cascading menus trying to find applications (especially when some people have upwards of 50 applications these days). The start menu search can even be used to find documents, pictures, and everything else Windows XP can; the only difference is that it will do so almost instantly unlike Windows XP, which can take hours depending on the amount of data on the hard drive. If you remember anything about the file (date edited, text from the file, filename, a property), you can probably find it.</p>
<p>A new feature in Windows Vista is the ability to save your searches. This is especially useful if you have an advanced search that you're going to want to do more than once. For example, if you've created a search that lists all of the documents pertaining to school on your hard drive, you could save that search and run it again later to get an updated list.</p>
<p>As a direct subset from the new search features found in Vista, it also now allows you to tag your files, adding your own metadata that search will pick up. This can be especially useful for tagging photos; later, you can search for a specific photo just by typing in who was in it.</p>

<p><b>Windows Sidebar + Gadgets</b></p>
<a href=\"inc/MSfiles/142/sidebar.png\" title=\"Vista Sidebar and Gadgets\"><img class=\"right\" src=\"inc/MSfiles/142/sidebarSmall.png\" alt=\"Vista Sidebar and Gadgets\" /></a>
<p>Windows Sidebar is a new feature in Vista. Like the name implies, it is a bar that rests on the right side of your screen and is the home for mini-applications called \"gadgets.\" Gadgets are basically the widgets that can be found on Macs, originally popularized by Konfabulator (now Yahoo! Widget Engine). Gadgets/widgets have many uses, including giving weather forecasts, news updates, or other types of information. They can be games, organizational helpers, and other extraordinarily useful things, like a widget that <a href=\"http://htime.tz4.com/\">tells you how much time is left in class</a>. Microsoft is currently working on creating more widgets (ahem, gadgets, excuse me) that users can download from their <a href=\"http://microsoftgadgets.com/\">gadget gallery</a>.</p>
<p><b>Security, Security, Security: User Account Control</b></p>
<p>Microsoft's focus in this OS has been security from the start. Countless users have complained about how XP has extremely (how shall we say it) crappy security. Mac users have used this as one of their main arguments in the long-debated \"Mac vs. PC\" battle, pointing to the fact that \"viruses can't run on Macs.\" However, it is true that Windows XP does have horrible security. Spyware, malware, and viruses all inherently make their way into the system no matter how careful the user is. The good news is that this is all about to change in Windows Vista (in theory).</p>
<p>The first step the Vista team has taken to improve security is to implement a new system (at least for Windows) called the User Account Control, or UAC. The problem with most Windows OS's to date is that most users run in an administrative mode, meaning that they can make drastic changes to the system (i.e. deleting essential system files, messing around with processes, installing random junk). Vista fixes this problem by making users run with low user privileges, so that they will not accidentally do something that will harm the computer. Basically, when the user is about to do something that could potentially harm the computer, a dialogue pops up asking the user if he or she really wants to do the action.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you've been following the developments on Vista lately, UAC has become the most hated feature coming into Windows. This is because of the extremely obtrusive and annoying way in which the Vista team decided to implement this feature. Absolutely <i>everything</i> required the user to confirm the action. Even doing something mundane like changing the system clock would require you to clarify that you really wanted to do it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this problem has been somewhat alleviated in Beta 2. Mundane tasks like changing the system clock or changing the power settings have been set to be automatically allowed by UAC, so that it is far less annoying.</p>
<p><b>Other Security Features</b></p>
<p>In addition to the newly implemented UAC, Microsoft has finally realized that XP security just isn't enough. They've added such features as a built-in firewall that monitors both inbound and outbound connections and the ability to encrypt the contents of a hard drive, which would be helpful in the case that users have sensitive or classified information on their computers.</p>
<p><b>Performance Improvement Features</b></p>
<p>Vista is a resource hog and has some pretty high system requirements. That said, Microsoft has foreseen this and added some new technologies that will improve computer performance: SuperFetch, ReadyBoost, and ReadyDrive.</p>
<p>SuperFetch allows for better computer responsiveness by pre-loading applications that you commonly use into memory, thus making these applications faster to load. It actually \"learns\" which applications you are most likely to use at different times (like on a Wednesday as compared to a Saturday). I'm not so sure about this feature, as it sounds like it will take up more system resources and knowing Microsoft, I can't say that SuperFetch will be very accurate knowing which applications I am going to run.</p>
<p>ReadyBoost allows the user to use a flash memory device as something of a RAM substitute, supposedly increasing performance that way. I'm also dubious of this feature because flash memory tends to be fragile and will probably break down after being written to so much.</p>
<p>ReadyDrive allows for faster boot times and longer battery life for computers that have a hybrid hard disc, a new type of hard drive that is equipped with flash memory. ReadyDrive works by utilizing the flash memory (which can be accessed faster than the physical hard drive).  Of course, these advantages can only be seen with computers with a hybrid drive, a new technology, so your best bet is to get a new computer when Vista comes out rather than upgrading.</p>

<p><b>Bundled Applications</b></p>
<p>Windows Vista would of course be nothing without the applications that actually make it useful. Among the most prominent bundled applications are the revamped Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player, to name a few.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 6 is a sad, sad joke. It surprises me how many people still use it, despite the fact that it lacks every security feature in existence, as well as lacking many features of other modern web browsers, including Opera and Mozilla Firefox, which sport tabbed browsing and support for RSS feeds. I'm thinking it must be a ploy to make IE7 look better. Internet Explorer 7 will have tabbed browsing, a feature sadly missing from IE6. Also, in Vista, IE7 operates in \"sandbox\" mode; temporary internet files operate in a section separate from the rest of the computer, so as to dampen the damage any spyware can do.</p>
<p>Windows Media Player has also been redone. It features a more aesthetically pleasing, as well as more intuitive, interface that shames its predecessor.  Windows Media Player is also suiting up to cater to the growing population of people with massive libraries of media files. It features a more graphical interface than iTunes; music is represented by CD stacks featuring the album art of the particular album the song belongs to. WMP 11 sports some new synchronization features, such as reverse synchronizing, getting files from the media device to the PC, and synchronizing with other PCs. Sadly, Windows Media Player has no support for synchronizing with the iPod, still the most popular mp3 player. Thus, it still won't be accepted widely as <i>the</i> media player of choice (over iTunes). With WMP 11, Microsoft is also working with MTV to bring in a new music subscription service, URGE, which Microsoft hopes will compete with the iTunes music subscription monopoly. That will probably not happen though, since users will find it more convenient to stick to iTunes for music on their iPods.</p>

<p><b>Progress Report</b></p>
<p>I actually first became interested in Windows Vista around February, when it was still rough around the edges. Well, maybe \"rough around the edges\" is an understatement. Like most of my nerdy (or what I like to call tech-savvy) peers, I was excited about the potential of a new, re-written (kind of) Windows operating system. However, I was disappointed by the first test build of Vista I tested (the February CTP). To say the least, it was actually extremely frustrating. Windows Explorer kept crashing, and I was forced to download third-party software to get Aero (which, if you'll remember, are the cool \"glass effects\") to run. You have no idea how long it took me to get that working. Although I was impressed by the glass effects, I was annoyed with the fact that it <i>lagged</i> when I moved windows around. Upon a more thorough look at the system options, I found out that Vista <i>didn't even recognize my graphics card</i> (a brand new Mobility Radeon X700). After beating myself over the head with my new laptop (resulting in some very deep regrets later), I switched back to using XP before uninstalling Vista.</p>
<p>Fast forward 4 months.</p>
<p>Beta 2 was released to the public in their CPP (Customer Preview Program) on June 7th at approximately 5:00 PM. I was able to get my hands on Vista the next day after an overnight download. (The file is upwards of 3 GB.) The instructions for installation of Vista include burning the DVD image to a DVD. However, since I lacked a DVD burner, I instead used Alcohol 120%, a CD emulation application, to load the DVD image and installed Vista to a newly created partition of my hard drive. (This actually works, for those of you who are stuck with no DVD burner as well.) The installation process was fairly straightforward and almost entirely automated, although long. The installation took around 40 minutes to an hour to complete, with some minor prompts to enter user account information.</p>
<p>After a smooth installation, I was brought to the Vista desktop. This time, Vista actually recognized my graphics card, enabling glass effects right away. Everything seemed to be running smoothly, except the start bar search, which took a while to get search results whenever I typed something in. Since it is supposed to be instant, I'm a little worried about that. There are a few other problems. Vista's UAC is still pretty annoying, for example when I tried deleting a folder from the \"Program Files\" folder, which is supposed to be like a system folder and is thus restricted from access by ordinary users. However, since I was on an administrator account, I did not have to repeatedly type in my password. Instead, it gave me a pop-up dialogue asking me if I really wanted to delete them, which I did. The problem with it was that since I was deleting some 100 files, the pop-up dialogue came up for every file I wanted to delete. There was an option to say yes to all of the pop-up dialogues, but that didn't seem to be working for me for some reason. Another problem with Beta 2 is that the system is still prone to crashes. While installing Trend Micro's PC-cillin, a security suite for Vista Beta 2, the system decided to lock up. After I did a force shut down and booted the computer back up, parts of PC-cillin were installed and were starting up, but others were uninstalled. Since PC-cillin did not completely install, it could not be uninstalled, a problem which was very frustrating, to say the least.</p>
<p>Some good things. Windows Vista is a lot better in its Beta 2 phase than its February CTP. A lot of frustrating problems, such as hardware support and system stability, have been resolved. However, there still remains much to be done before Vista is ready to be released. While Windows Explorer no longer \"crashes\" In Beta 2 (you'll find out why I use the quotation marks later), now, the start bar does freeze up, preventing me from accessing my applications, something that I'm sure will not be received well by the public. On to Windows Explorer. The good news: It no longer crashes. The bad news: I have no idea what it actually does. What I mean by that is Windows Explorer will all of a sudden <i>stop working</i>. And what I mean by that is that I can no longer access files, folders, or the control panel, all of which use Windows Explorer. How this happens is that I click on the folder on my desktop and wait. And wait. And wait. After about 20 minutes of waiting while I'm multitasking with my web browser and word-processor open, I figure out that it's not going to come up and that Windows Explorer has once again screwed up. The sad thing is that Microsoft won't know about this (from me, anyway) because since the system isn't aware that something is wrong, there is no error report to send. I know for sure I don't want to waste my time writing up a formal error report and sending it to them, but I applaud those true beta testers who want to waste their time for the benefit of mankind. Thank you.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, Windows Vista is really shaping up to become the operating system that Microsoft has promised it to be, but it is still a long way from completion. The next build of Windows Vista (after Beta 2), which was released not too long ago from the writing of this article, has gotten a lot of praise by tech writers, notably Paul Thurrott, who lauded it, saying that there was \"dramatic improvement in reliability, usability, performance, and fit and finish.\" So, I'm sure that Vista is really going to be everything that we end users have hoped for. Admittedly though, looking at Beta 2, I'm not really crossing my fingers.</p>
