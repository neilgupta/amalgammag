Who cared that Baby Betsy and Little Jonathan dreamt of a magical fairyland where toys came to life? I certainly didn't. Let Betsy and Jonathan grow up, introduce them to the nightmares of broken trust and unkind words. Let them experience pain. Let them be realistic.</p><p>I was sick of watching children, the ones I had once upon a time dusted, renounce their faith in me, pretend I didn't exist. They way I saw it, if they wouldn't acknowledge me alive, I wouldn't grace their dreams. They had my permission to dream about that fight they got in with Chris over the stuffed bear or getting a time-out. I was finished.</p><p>The day I was quitting my job, I visited one more batch of kids. I was in a hurry to finish the round of ten and get back to the Fairy Register to cross my name off the Sweet Dreams list. Let the little brats have nightmares, I thought to myself sourly. In my haste, hatred, and absent-mindedness, I flew into a window with an awake little girl.</p><p>\"You're a fairy!\" she said when she saw me, as if she was simply stating an ordinary fact. I was jerked out of my thoughts immediately, and was horrified at how I just endangered my world of fairies.</p><p>\"Um, no, this is just a dream,\" I said unconvincingly.</p><p>\"No it's not, Mommy just kissed me goodnight two seconds ago,\" the child replied smugly. Her tone then changed to one of pure happiness. \"I knew you were real! No one would believe me, but I knew fairies were real!\"</p><p>\"You did now?\" I asked, amused.</p><p>\"Of course,\" she said with a lisp. \"How else could spiders weave such sparkly webs? And who else makes the pretty fireflies and stars at night?\"</p><p>I smiled at her naivety. \"Those are real, darling, not fairy made.\" Her face fell in disappointment, and I quickly added, \"Now, dew drops on the grass in the morning, and your dreams, those are fairy made.\"</p><p>She chuckled triumphantly, while snuggling further in her bed covers. \"Will you tell me a story?\" she asked innocently.</p><p>I couldn't bear to refuse. Her face was so sweet, trusting, and believing. My old love for my job returned.</p><p>\"Once upon a time there was a magical kingdom,\" I began...</p><p>When I finished the tale of the Fairy King and Queen's battle against the evil witches, Carol, the little girl, was drowsy and ready to sleep. I kissed her forehead, sprinkled Sweet Dream dust on her, and left.</p><p>\"Wait!\" she cried as I flew out the window.</p><p>\"Yes, dear?\" I asked, returning, \"Do you need something?\"</p><p>\"Can you come back tomorrow?\" she shyly requested.  At that moment, I thought about my plan of quitting my job because of all the uncaring, cruel children. One child wasn't enough to change my mind. But this girl was worth coming back to every night.</p><p>\"Carol,\" I said, sadly, \"Tonight is my last night as a Dream Maker. After tonight, if I visit you, I can't guarantee you sweet dreams. I can only tell you stories.\"</p><p>\"I'm okay with that,\" said the girl, delighted. \"I'm always grown up in my dreams anyway. I wasn't allowed to believe in fairies in them. And now because I've seen a real fairy my dreams are going to be nice anyways, because now I'm allowed to believe in them!\"</p><p>While I couldn't completely follow her logic, my heart was touched, and a tear ran down my cheek. A child believed in me.</p><p>With a smile, I waved goodbye. \"See you tomorrow,\" I said as I glided out the window. \"And sweet dreams.\"</p>";include ($Server_incRoot . 'authors/' . $aid .
