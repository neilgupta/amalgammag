<p>"For \'tis there in, where nothing important lies, where the balance hangs precariously, that the truth may be found." Kelly paused for breath.</p>
<p>	"Who talks like that anymore?" Jane asked from where she lay in the grass by Kelly\'s side. Kelly rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>	"You know you like it," she teased.</p>
<p>	"You know you like it," Jane mimicked.</p>
<p>	"You know you want me to read more."</p>
<p>	"No, I just want you!" Jane sprang up and tackled Kelly. The book lay forgotten as the girls tussled in the fall leaves. They tussled until Jane whacked her head against the tree.</p>
<p>	"Ow!" Jane stopped to hold her head.</p>
<p>	"Want me to kiss it and make it all better?" Kelly asked.</p>
<p>	"Uh-huh," Jane nodded. Kelly tenderly kissed Jane\'s head. Jane smiled up at the brunette, leaves tangled in her hair. Kelly gently disentangled herself and retrieved the paperback. She leaned against the tree. Jane crawled over and put her head in Kelly\'s lap. Kelly returned to reading out loud as Jane slowly drifted towards sleep.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>	The bell rang and it was as if floodgates had opened. Students poured out, more than ready for the weekend. Kelly waited by locker 112. Soon the familiar head of black hair appeared. Kelly frowned; the brown eyes had lost their smiling spark. Kelly hurried towards her. Jane saw Kelly and flung herself at the girl. Kelly held her as Jane buried her head in Kelly\'s shoulder. Soon the hallway emptied.</p>
<p>	"What is it?" Kelly asked softly.</p>
<p>	"Will died." She started to sob.</p>
<p>	"Oh Janie," Kelly whispered into her hair, hugging her close. <i>And to think I used to be jealous of the way she looked at that horse.</i> "What happened?"</p>
<p>	"He got caught in the fence, ripped his leg apart. They had to put him down." Janie pulled back enough to look into Kelly\'s compassionate face, then reached up a little to kiss her. Kelly wiped the tears from Jane\'s face, then handed her a crumpled tissue. Slowly they left the school, hand in hand.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>	"It\'s the end of the world as we know it," Kelly sang quietly, too exhausted to move. Jane lay on the bed next to her, holding her hand in the dark. It had been a <i>long</i> day.</p>
<p>	"I\'m sorry," Jane whispered quietly.</p>
<p>	"It\'s not your fault Janie. I just... I hoped they wouldn\'t react that way."</p>
<p>	"It\'s not your fault either Hun. If they hate you for loving, that\'s their problem."</p>
<p>	"I know, it\'s just... they\'re my parents and I still love them, hopefully all they need is some time."</p>
<p>	"You can stay here as long as you want."</p>
<p>	"Thanks."</p>
<p>	"I love you Kelly."</p>
<p>	"I love you too Janie."</p>
<p>	Jane rolled over and hugged Kelly. They lay surrounded by the dark, content just to hold each other.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>	"Come on, let\'s go!" Jane urged her horse on.</p>
<p>	"Slow down! Horses are slippery without a saddle."</p>
<p>	"Yeah, but isn\'t it a wondrous feeling, their heat radiating outwards, being able to <i>feel</i> their muscles stretch and bunch. Can\'t you just feel the thundering avalanche sitting under you, just waiting to explode?" Jane gushed. Kelly smiled.</p>
<p>	"Yeah. Just slow down a little, I can\'t quite keep up with you."</p>
<p>	"Sure," Jane reigned in her horse. They ambled along the trail. When they came to an open field, Jane spurred her horse into a trot. She easily posted to the beat. Kelly sped her horse on. Then Jane broke into a gallop and Kelly followed suit. <i>I know exactly what she\'s talking about</i>, Kelly thought, feeling the magnificent power beneath her. It was wild, yet she was in control. She smiled and overtook Jane.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>	Jane gently brushed Kelly\'s hair, and then twisted it up into a fancy bun. She carefully removed a few brown tendrils and let them frame Kelly\'s face. Then she came around to her front, making sure the bathrobe fully covered Kelly\'s dress. She carefully applied make-up as music softly played in the background.</p>
<p>	"Done," Jane said softly. </p>
<p>	"Finally," Kelly grinned, playing with the large, soft, blush-brush. "Your turn." Kelly stood and removed the robe. Jane grinned.</p>
<p>	"You\'re beautiful," Jane told her. And she was. Kelly\'s gown was strapless and reached the floor. The top was a deep red that faded as it reached the floor. Around her pale neck, Kelly wore a golden locket. Inside was a picture of Jane.</p>
<p>	"Your turn." Kelly helped Jane slip the bathrobe over her green dress that accented her dark skin. Kelly began by brushing Jane\'s still damp hair. When Kelly was done, Jane shed the robe and spun in a circle, her dress flaring out then settling a few inches below her knees. Jane adjusted the halter strap then dropped her arms to let Kelly see.</p>
<p>	"Wow," was the only word Kelly could form. She noted the emerald earrings she had given Jane dangling from her ears.</p>
<p>	"It\'s time!" Jane exclaimed glancing at the clock. They slipped on their strappy sandals, gold ones for Kelly, and pale green for Jane. After grabbing their coats, the young women left.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>	Kelly lay alone on her bed in the dark. She couldn\'t stop sobbing. A book lay beside her. The page that was open began "For \'tis there in, where nothing important lies..." It was Wednesday and she hadn\'t been to class all week. She couldn\'t bring herself to care. <i>I don\'t want to live without her</i>, she thought. There was a soft knock on the apartment door.</p>
<p>	"Go away," Kelly choked out. There was silence and she buried her head back into her pillow. A key grated in the lock and the door softly opened. Jane padded in timidly. She stood awkwardly by the bedroom door.</p>
<p>	"I\'m so sorry," Jane whispered.</p>
<p>	"Jane?" Kelly lifted her head.</p>
<p>	"Oh," Jane gasped and rushed forward to perch on Kelly\'s bed. She reached forward but pulled back, afraid of what she had done. Tears slipped down her face.</p>
<p>	"I\'m so sorry. I just got so scared. I really do love you."</p>
<p>	"Mean it?" Kelly looked as vulnerable as a small child.</p>
<p>	"I do."</p>
<p>	"I\'ve always loved you."</p>
<p>	Jane now dared to touch Kelly. At that first contact Kelly flung herself at Jane and clung on as if her life depended on it. After a few long minutes Jane spoke.</p>
<p>	"We should get you cleaned up, then you need food."</p>
<p>	"Ok." Kelly sniffed and let Jane pull her up and lead her by the hand.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>	Jane and Kelly were hiking though hills. It was a beautiful summers day.</p>
<p>	"Let\'s stop for a minute," Kelly said, perching on a boulder, watching Jane carefully, she had been acting odd all day.</p>
<p>	"Sure," Jane sat beside Kelly.</p>
<p>	"Can I talk to you?" Jane asked.</p>
<p>	"Always," Kelly told her.</p>
<p>	"Remember when I told you to never ask me to marry you \'cause I\'m too scared?"</p>
<p>	"Yes." Hope flashed across Kelly\'s face.</p>
<p>	"I\'m not too scared anymore. Kelly," Jane knelt down on the trail and reached into her pocket. "Will you marry me?"</p>
<p>	Kelly\'s eyes filled with tears. "Yes, <i>yes, YES!</i>" She flung herself at Jane, the two kneeling there in the trail hugging and crying, the happiest they had ever been. </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>	"Can you feel it?" Jane asked. She and Kelly were standing in an empty field, shoes discarded and twilight surrounding them.</p>
<p>	"Feel what?" asked Kelly absently, sniffing the summer\'s air.</p>
<p>	"Feel the earth."</p>
<p>	Kelly wiggled her toes in the warm dirt. "Yeah."</p>
<p>	"Feel it moving, just under the surface. Don\'t you feel the shifting? The world is always changing, never still." Jane\'s voice was just above a whisper.</p>
<p>	"As long as you\'re with me, the world can change as much as it wants," Kelly said squeezing Jane\'s hand. Jane closed her eyes.</p>
<p>	"It\'s like we\'re surrounded by golden water, but it\'s light. It\'s always flowing."</p>
<p>	"The world flows and shifts around us, but we hold on to each other. As long as we have each other, nothing can touch us." Kelly drew Jane near and tenderly kissed her lips. Jane slid her arms around Kelly, kissing back. They stood in the middle of the field, bodies connected at every possible point. In that moment, they were not two halves, but one whole. </p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>	"Black?" Kelly stood at the podium, speaking to the masses. "What is this "black" you speak of? Is it the night sky? It can\'t be, for that is a deep, dark blue. Is it ink? That\'s not really black, but a rainbow of reflected colors. Or do you mean people? Those of "African decent"," Kelly made air quotes. "I know a "black" woman, and she\'s amazing. Her smile and laugh are some of the most beautiful things in the world. Her skin, though, is not black. Not like her eyes, not like her hair. Not even like her cousins in the heart of Sudan who have skin the color of charcoal. The charcoal she smears on paper to create a picture. She draws what she sees. She sees pain and oppression. She has opened my eyes. Oh, be sure I saw it before. You don\'t come out of your lesbian closet at fourteen and not know hate. But she opened my eyes wider, to things I naively passed over before. When people can\'t see past that beautiful ebony skin, it breaks my heart. The first time it happened, we were in a little cafe. I was given my drink quickly, but her\'s never came. When confronted, they insisted that they "reserved the right to refuse service". Boy was I ever mad. She tried to calm me.</p>
<p>	\'Kelly,\' she said, \'babe, calm down. It\'s ok. It\'s not the first time this has happened.\' I flamed. It\'s bad enough with people trying to tell us who we can and cannot love. But didn\'t we win a war about this years ago? Wasn\'t there something about a turning point when the North won the Civil War? But no, the war was not over. People who don\'t live it often forget this, but the war is <i>still</i> not over. There are laws, sure, but that doesn\'t stop the hate. Think about it. Why do people hate? They are <i>taught</i>. Growing up, I was taught to loath and abhor homosexuals and I had to be taught to love myself. We need to reach the children. We must teach them to accept. The war is not over yet, but we <i>must</i> win it with love. Fighting hate with hate <i>will not help</i>. We must teach and encourage acceptance. This has gone on long enough. The hate must stop <i>today</i>."</p>
<p>	There was a long moment of silence at the end of Kelly\'s speech. Then thunderous applause broke out and there were shouts and cheers. Kelly smiled. Jane rose, tears in her dark eyes. Soon everyone was standing, supporting, agreeing. Kelly stepped down and was engulfed in the beautiful ebony arms of her partner.</p>
