<p>WARNING: the following review is essentially a gigantic SUMMARY OF THE MOVIE. This means that there are obviously SPOILERS.</p>


<p>If you\'re looking for a good adventure movie, they don\'t get much better than this. Not only is this the best Indiana Jones movie, it is also probably one of the top 10 action movies of all time. And of the three Jones movies, even though it\'s not as well scripted as <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> or as epic as <i>The Last Crusade</i>, it is definitely the most enjoyable.</p>

<p>Where to start... well, like all the other Jones movies, it opens with a large-scale action scene, this time taking place in a Chinese restaurant involving mobsters, a diamond, a bottle of antidote, a gong, Tommy guns, and balloons. The scene itself is hilarious and exciting, containing some very memorable moments. For example, Jones sends this one bad guy straight to hell by throwing a flaming skewer into his heart. A FLAMING SKEWER. I\'ve been to my fair share of Chinese restaurants, and I have NEVER EVER seen skewers that were ON FIRE. Totally awesome. Then there\'s the oh-so-famous gong sequence where Jones shields himself behind a rolling gong from bullets (a sequence that was later ripped off by The Scorpion King).</p>

<p>In the restaurant, Jones meets this singer named Willie, who is the whiniest little ***** I have ever seen. They escape the restaurant by jumping out of a window and conveniently landing inside a car driven by Jones\' 12 year old ally Short Round (Shorty). Now, normally I find kids to be irritating, especially in action movies. However, Short Round has this thing about him that makes him really cool. It might have something to do with the fact that he\'s the only kid I\'ve ever seen who is willing to run over innocent pedestrians during car chases. Ok, he doesn\'t actually kill anybody, but he launches the wagon pulling a guy 10 feet into a pile of wooden boxes. That has to hurt.</p>

<p>After the intense (and hilarious) car chase, Jones, Willie, and Shorty get on a plane, which just happens to be owned by the Chinese mobster that they\'ve been spending the entire opening scene escaping. Obviously, the pilots are ordered to kill them in such a manner that gives Jones and his pals ample opportunity to escape. So they empty out the fuel from the plane and then jump out while Jones, Willie, and Shorty are sleeping (who knows where they landed). What happens next redefines the word "implausible." Willie wakes up and sees that nobody is flying the plane, so she goes and wakes Jones up. None of them knows how to fly, all of the parachutes are gone, and the propellers have stopped moving. There is, however, a life raft, so Jones decides to jump out of the plane while inflating the raft with everyone on it about one and a half thousand feet high (the fall lasted about 14 seconds. I counted). Of course they don\'t die. They slide down a mountain, off a cliff, and into a river. They meet some creepy old Indian lady who guides them to her village. We later find out that some people had recently stolen their lucky Shankara stone and kidnapped the children. They send Indiana Jones to retrieve the stone, and he happily obliges, hoping to take it to a museum as an important archeological find.</p>

<p>Jones sets off with Willie and Shorty, and they arrive at this gigantic palace, where they are invited to dinner. The dinner scene is classic, full of live snakes, beetles, eyeball soups, and monkey brains. Hilarious stuff; you need to watch it to fully appreciate the humor. Jones also talks with the Maharaja of the palace, the Maharaja\'s assistant, and this English colonel who happens to be there. We learn a bit about this thing called the Thuggee cult, who apparently committed horrible crimes in the past. Of course, we later learn that the entire palace is run by Thuggees, but we\'ll get to that later. </p>

<p>After dinner, the romance between Willie and Jones develops (finally). Of course, they get into a childish argument that ends with Willie daring Jones to come back into her room in five minutes so that they can make love or something. Now, I usually hate romance scenes because they are boring, pointless, and usually stupid, and it is easy to be misled by this scene because you\'d think that the movie would descend into some pointless romance movie. We get shots of Jones fixing his hair, cleaning his teeth, and putting on decent clothes. Once 5 minutes are up, he gets up and heads for the door. And THEN some guy comes out of NOWHERE and starts STRANGLING HIM. Naturally a fight erupts, and Jones wins of course. It\'s a pretty nice movie death too, where Jones whips the guy around the neck and gets the whip caught into a fan, which lifts the guy up by his neck until his face gets pulverized by the fan.</p>

<p>One thing leads to another, and Jones finds a secret passage in Willie\'s room. So he goes with Shorty and Willie, where they encounter booby traps, spikes, skulls, and fortune cookies... er, I mean bugs. Shorty seems to have the worst luck in the world; everything he touches seems to be a booby trap. In fact, he single-handedly gets both himself and Jones locked in a room where the roof grows spikes and slowly starts coming down to crush whoever happens to be inside. Willie, of course, is forced to wander through these bugs in order to save them. Hilarious stuff.</p>

<p>They then stumble onto a Thuggee sacrifice, where they seem to be worshiping the Shankara stones. These Thuggees are the most badass people since the Aztecs. I mean, they find it necessary to sacrifice people first by ripping their heart out and THEN incinerating them in a pit of lava (yes, somehow they have a pit of lava. I guess they live in a volcano...).</p>

<p>Anyways, Jones and his gang get captured. Jones gets turned into a Thuggee (by drinking blood), Shorty gets turned into a slave (because all the children from the village became slaves too), and Willie gets sacrificed in the volcano pit thing. Except they escape. They fight their way through the baddies, and they eventually escape via a mine cart. There were also some awesome fistfights, including one where Shorty beats the maharaja to a bloody pulp and another where Jones fights this HUGE guy, gets beat up at first, but ultimately gets back up and forces him into some big rolling thing, resulting in a nice juicy death scene.</p>

<p>So yea, there are fights, mine carts, more fights, and then the bridge scene. The good guys win and the kids are reunited to their parents. Oh, and Jones and Willie kiss at the end. That\'s pretty much it. Ok, yea, I was too lazy to finish the detailed summary, but you get the idea. This movie rocks. I don\'t understand why most consider it the weakest of the three Jones movies; I found it the best. It didn\'t drag like Raiders and it didn\'t get too lighthearted like Last Crusade. It was dark, but fun at the same time. So yea, see it if you have not seen it already. If you have, see it again.</p>
