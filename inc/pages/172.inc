<p>It was on the path by the hills, returning from the market, that I first encountered <i>that</i> cat. The sky was overcast with clouds, and it was, all in all, a dismal night. As for the cat, it sat quietly in the middle of my accustomed path home, eyes looking towards me. It was nondescript grayish white, the color which linen takes on after dirtied with mud even after the mud is cleansed off with numerous washings. Even as the heavens began to rumble with thunder, the cat patiently sat, never closing an eyelid to break that piercing gaze. I at once observed a curious anomaly: this cat was white, but had eyes red as rubies! In the dim light, the eyes seemed to be glowing with a luminescent aura, giving off an ominous feel.</p>
<p>"It must be one of those peculiar specimens of the albino persuasion," I noted, as chills ran down my spine. Satisfied, I decided to hurry home to the warmth of a roaring fire before I was caught in some untimely shower, leaving the albino still sitting on the path. No sooner had I gone for a few minutes, did I hear an unearthly meow behind me. I nearly cried out in surprise, but when turning about, I merely saw that cat. But oh, that <i>cat</i>! Those dreadful eyes seemed twice the size as before, two bright red lanterns in the darkness! I shrank back, and resolved myself to be rid of this cat. Turning back towards my home, I settled into a brisk walk.</p>
<p>The cat followed, giving out that same meow.</p>
<p>I increased my speed to a light jog.</p>
<p>The cat did as well.</p>
<p>No matter how quickly I ran, how quickly I flailed, lungs gasping short of air, the cat matched my speed. And so the two of us ran the entire distance, I running as if pursued by demons and <i>it</i> all the while coming after, still giving out those hellish yelps. At last, I could see the outline of my cottage in the quickly fading light. I put my burning legs to one more burst of speed, and ran to the open door, quickly throwing it shut and bolting it. Panting behind the door, arms pushed against it as if that demon would come bursting in, I listened for any sounds of <i>it</i>. Hearing nothing, I chanced a glimpse outside. Seeing no eerie red glow to indicate the presence of the cat, I sighed with relief, but dared not unbolt the door. Instead, it already being a late hour and me being exhausted from my physical exertion, it seemed wise that I retire to my bed for a restful night of sleep.</p>
<p>But it was not to be so.</p>
<p>My dreams were haunted with monstrous cats with blood-red eyes as large as dinner plates, chasing after me in every direction; over mountains, through the sky, beneath the sea. I fitfully tossed and turned, seeing nothing but cats upon cats and hearing nothing but those terrifying meows. At last I was startled awake, entangled in my blankets and covered with a light sheen of sweat, heartbeat still racing. At first I knew not what had awakened me, and lay in silence to try and ascertain this fact. And then I heard <i>it</i>! Not but five paces from my bed! I shivered and clutched my blankets, hearing again...that quiet meow, on edge of hearing. I turned my head slowly, fearful of seeing that dreadful cat. And there! At the foot of my bed! Not a cat, but a lone grayish white paw. I watched, paralyzed with horror as another paw appeared to sit motionless beside it. Slowly, another paw appeared! And another! Leg by leg, piece by piece, the whole cat slowly faded into being, until it was almost complete. All that remained were <i>those eyes</i>! I shrank back as the eyeless cat began walking towards me with the appearance of a cat stalking its prey, none other than I! "Begone!" I cried, to stop it from coming closer. I pushed my blankets against it, to stop that inevitable approach, but I could still see the face of the cat, as those eyes filled the walls with that red glow! It was too late! <i>The cat sat upon my bed</i>! It stared at me, with those eyes from Hell! It gave out one meow and leapt upon me with claws outstretched! I gave one shriek!--and then there was nothing.</p>
