<?php$aid = 'kritika';$title = 'Anorexia';$cid = c15;$issueid = i1;$body = "<p>It affects millions of people all around the world. These people suffer constantly from a distorted body image, and fear of gaining weight. Anorexia nervosa is the leading psychiatric ailment, with at least 10% of junior high and high school students suffering from it.</p><p>	 Anorexia nervosa is a condition where underweight people think they are fat, and thus go on extraordinary diets, which can result in death. Often, social problems are the root of anorexia. Today's society often forces people to think that they must be thin. Successful actors, musicians and stars often have the so-called, \"perfect body,\" misleading many people into thinking that a slim waist, instead of talent, is a major factor in success. Peer pressure is a common cause of anorexia as well. A person's friends going on a diet might cause that person to be extremely sensitive about his or her own weight.  Many times, the worst possible insult is calling a person fat. The desire to be thin has integrated itself into people's lives to such an extent, that many times even knowing that death is a possible result does not stop a person from taking extreme measures to lose weight. </p><p>	Most often eating disorders are associated with females, particularly teenagers, but anorexia is as common with men as it is with women. However, the idea of only women being affected by anorexia exists because men are often reluctant to publicly reveal their condition. Again, this is caused by a stereotype of society that men must be bodybuilders with lots of muscle, and \"a six pack.\" </p><p>	People inflicted with anorexia often go to extreme measures to lose weight. This might include excessive exercise, eating barely anything, overdosing on laxative pills as well as diet pills.</p><p>	There are a countless number of risks due to anorexia, which can severely damage the body or cause death. However, some noticeable signs that a person may have anorexia include extreme dieting, frequent complaints about weight or gaining weight, loss of hair, loss of sleep, or depression. For boys, the signs are often much more subtle than with girls. Immediate help and care is required for an anorexic person, and if not given, it can lead to severe health issues.</p><p>	Although it takes time, anorexia can be cured. There are many different programs all throughout the United States designed to help people with eating disorders.
