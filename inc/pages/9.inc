I'm not denying the validity of some of your points. However, I take issue with the way you've presented these facts and grossly exaggerated what may or may not be an issue of race. </p><p>The entire \"race-based\" rhetoric used throughout the article suggests the very \"race-based presumptions\" that your article mentions as offensive to the Asian community. Through the primarily one sided quotes you've gathered, the comments from the Monta Vista High School representative that you've skewed, and the \"blunt\" phrasing (i.e. \"whiter\" schools, \"too Asian\",\"intense competition\") scattered throughout the actual facts, you've essentialized the racial/social situation at these local high schools to the point where it's a minor form of propaganda.</p><p>While as a writer, you can take license with imagery and factual evidence, your dramatization does suggest a common theme throughout the article which many readers, especially the Asian community, find disturbing: \"Against a sea of Asian faces, the few white students were easy to pick out. One boy sat on a wall, his lighter hair and skin making him stand out from dozens of others around him. In another corner, four white male students lounged at a picnic table.\" Perhaps this article is suggesting that Caucasian students are, though the clear majority in America, a discriminated minority that is forced to flee from the Asian academic domination? The magnitude of any \"cultural conflict\" or \"flight\" that's constructed in the presentation of facts and opinions in the article is not only distorted, but suggests a form of racial division, which in light of historical racial issues, seems to be a mere exaggeration.</p><p>Even if I were to agree with the generalizations and stereotypes endorsed in the article, I would have to wonder, if in fact there is \"little evidence of any overt racial tension between students or between their parents\", why are these facts being cast as racial causes? Perhaps it's an issue of cultural assimilation, but portraying the problem as simply an \"overwhelming of a particular race\" issue does not accurately reflect the core problems.</p><p>Interestingly, much of the drive behind the \"Asian competitive mentality\" is a cause of existent prejudice and racial bigotry - many Asian students are taught to work hard knowing that they have to if they want to be able to adequately compete with their \"whiter\" neighbors, the same ones complaining that their children are victims of comparison with the successes of their Asian counterparts.</p> <p>Coming from a very intensive private school, I see on a daily basis both Asian and Caucasian students voluntarily challenging themselves with rigorous courses and extra-curriculars. Your generalized characterization of students of both ethnicities can only be negative for the cultural unity in an area known for its diversity.</p>Sincerely,<br>Stephanie Lio";include ($Server_incRoot .
