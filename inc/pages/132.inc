<p>Herman's eyes wandered around the drably lit office room, stopping every now and then to investigate anything that remotely resembled some form of proof that life existed.  After a stretch of time which could have been a minute or just as easily an hour, Herman decided that life did, in fact, exist.  \"After all,\" he thought, \"how could I possibly see what is around me if my eyes are not alive to do so?  Then again, maybe they're not... Perhaps my eyes, and myself along with them, are nothing more than a few strands of vibrating color that coincidentally drifted into the form of what knows itself a human being.\"</p>
<p>\"Or,\" Herman thought to himself, not noticing the small speck on the wall in front of him, \"perhaps I'm God.\" The thought hit Herman with a strange morsel of self-confidence.  \"Well that would certainly be nice.  And not too farfetched either; it would only make sense.  Say that through whatever means, I was created, and was the only thing in the cosmos.  Being the only thing in the cosmos, I had the most ultimate possible power; pure omnipotence.  This, of course, had no effect on me; I had the ability to know, think, or do anything that was right or wrong, possible or impossible, positive or negative, kinetic or static, though no starting point to utilize it.  Then, I thought.  That was my first mistake.</p>
<p>\"Having thought, I had cut a hole in the dam of nothingness.  My thought existed; therefore I had created another thing in the cosmos, and I knew it was too late and impossible to destroy it.\" Herman then realized there was a hole in his hypothesis. \"But wait... how could I not have been able to destroy it?  I had omnipotence... Perhaps I wanted to create the world as the human apparition I now think of as myself sees it?  But there is positivism and negativism in this world; this means that I introduced pain and suffering into the cosmos... some God I was... or am?  Oh yeah... that's right! Why don't I remember any of this?  Did I efface my record of action and knowledge of my power so as not to...\" Herman had trouble with this thought, but after the speck took a good look around, he finally arrived at a conclusion: \"continue along my path of inevitable folly!  Yes, it makes perfect sense, thought in the cosmos results in emotion, which leads to pain and suffering.  Of course, the pain and suffering could just be the opposite side of emotion as a whole, and it is required in order to have love and joy... Wow... who'd have thought being the ultimate deity would be so... blurry.\"</p>
<p>Another thought landed in Herman's head.  \"Blurry...  Blurry is a word.  Words exist.  Words exist and were created by humans.  If an existing being can create, then it exists, and humans created words, so humans must exist...  I guess I created them... I created separate minds and souls in addition to thoughts...\"</p>
<p>Herman wondered what he could derive from his discovery.  The speck began to creep around the off-white white wall when Herman had yet another thought, \"They started out as bumbling cavemen who had no idea how to use a stick to kill a rodent, and are now bumbling sentient men who can use a piece of metal to go to the moon...\"</p>
<p>Herman was about to reach the most horrifying conclusion that any being had ever come to; a thought so chilling it could have given hypothermia to a walrus.</p>
<p>\"They learned.\"</p>
<p>\"My god... I created beings with minds possessing the ability to think freely and acquire knowledge.  Imagine the consequences of such a gesture...  I am no longer the only sentient or productive being in the cosmos... but wait... that means...\"</p>
<p>The little black speck on the wall began to scurry in the direction it believed to be up, and extemporaneously proceeded to fly around the room until tiring out and landing on Herman's head.  Little did the speck know that its landing pad was also the host of a thought that gave Herman the same feeling as a man investigating the asphyxiation of his pet, only to realize after countless hours of searching that the fishbowl had had no water in it.</p>
<p>\"Oh hell!  I'm not God after all!  Or at least, no more than the rest of the five billion other humans on this excrement of a planet.\"</p>
<p>Herman's flicker of self-confidence wavered at the realization that he was not God, but erected once more when he realized he'd just successfully completed one of his most provoking philosophical ramblings to date.</p>
<p>Those who knew Herman well generally described Herman as a good fellow, his weak points for the most part outshined by the strong, always there to lend a hand when something went awry, and one more adjective.  He couldn't be considered wealthy, but he was twice as happy with his meager earnings as most rich men were with theirs.  He had relatively few friends- not through a lack of social skills, but because he needed no more than he had; he liked the few enough to get by with happiness to spare.  The final adjective that Herman's acquaintances usually used to describe him is \"happy.\" Although they normally assumed this was because of his physical and social lifestyle, what really made Herman such a happy man was his favorite hobby: philosophy.  Herman treated philosophy like a stamp-collection.  He never had the desire to write a book or make money off of his thoughts, but he fancied the thought of one day learning the answers to life and the sort.</p>
<p>The clock on the wall finally ticked its way to five o'clock, as if inviting Herman to pack his case, head home, and eventually fall asleep. He did.  And as much as a cave man knows how to go to the moon using only a piece of metal, Herman knew he'd created the caveman.</p>
