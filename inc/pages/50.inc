<p> <img src="inc/MSfiles/50/Hellsing_title.jpg" width="220" height="124" class="right" /> Hellsing - not <i>Van</i> Hellsing, mind you, but Hellsing - is a popular anime and manga series, with a complete thirteen episode series available in the US and eight volumes of the manga released, several of which have been translated and made available for purchase in the US. It has been extremely successful, and has generated a massive fan base, to the extent of even fan-comics (doujinshi) such as <a href="http://www.hellsing.comicgenesis.com">And Shine Heaven Now</a>.  In this fan circles, a massive stir was generated by the announcement of a second animated release of Hellsing - not as an anime series, but an OVA, an Original Video Animation, or an anime released as a movie, often in parts.  Fans eagerly anticipated its release, and finally the first part has been aired - in Japan, anyway. Soon afterwards, the file was placed online, and it wasn\'t long before fans had subtitled the entire video in English and posted the release online for everyone.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with Hellsing, the story centers on the Hellsing Organization, a secret branch of the British military that hunts down vampires, ghouls, and similar supernatural threats.  Among the main characters are Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, the young woman leading the Hellsing Organization (yes, SIR Integra, she\'s a knight), Alucard, one of her best agents whose specialties you learn early on, and Seras Victoria, a young police officer who ends up accidentally in the midst of a vampire and his ghouls. It is an action series, and a bloody good one at that - quite literally, there is quite a bit of gore, though nothing particularly bad. The start of the OVA is different from that of the series, but the scene is a fan favorite from later in the series; it derivates from the anime version, but is still impressively done. The story then jumps to the storyline of the first few episodes, condensed and tweaked considerably, but still quite well done.  I have yet to get a hold of the manga, but I\'ve heard the OVA is more faithful to the manga than the anime, which was released after only two volumes of the manga - however, the part that has aired so far is still in the common ground between the two.</p>

<p>The animation uses more technical, computerized effects. As someone who prefers the more hand-drawn, simple style of animation than the semi-realistic animation applied to the non-realistic characteristic anime world, I liked the original more. In particular, the appearances of Walter and Sir Integra were slightly jarring to me. Still, the animation quality is high, and those who like the style will love it.</p>

<p> <img src="inc/MSfiles/50/Hellsing_Integra.jpg" width="220" height="124" class="left" /> While I have my complaints, most notably, the slight changes to the animation style, the more comedic feel at parts, and a noticable difference in Seras - she is far more assertive and comes to terms with herself far more easily than in the anime - the OVA is still masterfully done, and a solid offering. Scenes like <b>(minor spoiler warning, skip the next bold part to avoid it)</b> Alucard\'s battle with Father Anderson and Seras sniping the second of the FREAK\'s from the second episode of the series <b>(end spoiler)</b> were brilliantly done, and I found it to be excellent on the whole. I\'m not the only one - the OVA has quite a bit of popularity among the Hellsing fan base. For Hellsing fans, it\'s a must-see; for fans of the action genre, I strongly recommend it; for others, I\'d still suggest taking a look. One thing that I mentioned but that bears repeating - it has English subtitles, but is entirely in Japanese. If you don\'t want to jump into fansubs like that, the original series is available with English dubbing from US companies, so that\'s still worth taking a look at. All in all, I have to say that I definitely recommend watching the series.</p>

<p><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/hellsing/793577.html">A direct download</a>, but you\'ll need WinRAR to deal with the multiple parts.  Also, it\'s in .mkv format, but the link has links to a player or a Windows Media Player plugin you can get.</p>

<p><a href="http://ts.searching.com/torrent/538157/BF_BoH_Hellsing_OVA_I_FULL_50_MIN_EPISODE_WITH_ENGLISH_SUBTITLES">A torrent link</a>, also .mkv. The first link can walk you through using the format, again.</p>
