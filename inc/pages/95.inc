<p>Typing up the last few columns from a spreadsheet, I glance down at the paper. I notice an ant meandering its way across the orderly lines of numbers. Quickly, I grab a tissue and smash it, grinding it into said paper before it can wander any further. As I carefully toss the tissue into the wastebasket, I am wary not to let the small crushed corpse touch any part of my fingers. I vigorously wipe the paper with another tissue to cleanse it of any lingering ant remains. Assuring myself that the ant is truly dead, I return to my work. Finally, finishing the last row of numbers, movement catches my eye. I steal a glance at it out of the corner of my eye, and almost leap out of my chair in surprise.</p>
<p>Another ant! As I instinctively reach for the tissue box, yet another ant crawls onto my desk. It pulls itself over the rim of the desk, and another quickly follows behind it, and then yet another! Before I can react, my desk has turned into an enormous ant farm with ants swarming over every inch of unclaimed space. I suddenly regain control of my hands, pull out a clump of tissues, and begin crushing ants left and right. But as the tissue comes smashing down on each ant, one after another, I begin to feel resistance, as if there is a force pushing my hand back up. I look down, only to see the ants begin to swell. Growing to the size of first cockroaches and then dogs, the ants topple the desk with their combined weight. They continue expanding, pushing me over onto the ground with their bony legs. A giant ant head turns to me and extends its snapping pincers straight towards me. Suddenly, a loud ringing fills my ears.</p>
<p>My eyes snap open, still seeing the giant mandibles. I wipe off the sheen of cold sweat that covers me, and stare at the blank white ceiling, breathing heavily. I finally reach over to turn off the still-blaring alarm. \"6:00 AM,\" the blinking red numbers inform me. I sigh. Today is the first day of my being a manager at the company and I cannot be late. I quickly shower, get dressed, and collect my things for work. The office is empty at 6:30, the corridors only lighted by the few exit signs and the dim twilight. Turning on the lights as I go to my old office, I walk down the corridor. There the entire contents of my office sit, condensed into three small moving boxes. They sit alone in the middle of the cubicle, surrounded by bare walls. <i>Ten long years of my life, and three boxes to show for it.</i> I sigh again, and lug the boxes slowly down the hall to my new office.</p>
<p>The office is empty, except for a desk, a chair, a computer, and a small window. I look out the window, to see the bleak face of another office building. I wonder about the occupants of the other building. What are they doing? Are they sitting at a desk that they will occupy for the rest of their lives? Or are they working on useless projects to satisfy the whims of their managers? I turn back to the boxes, opening them one by one. Folders, books, more books. Keyboard, stapler, a small pencil holder. Picking it up, I see the image of a meadow dotted by colorful flowers. Many times I would gaze at the pencil holder, imagining myself in that meadow. Lying in long grass, looking up at white clouds drifting across the sky like colossal creatures... the air is fresh, filled with the smell of flowers, and the trees sway in the gentle breeze. I put the pencil holder down, placing it on my desk along with the other items. I assign each a new spot, where they will remain until they become useless and are thrown away. I sit back down, having finished unpacking, and lower my head in order to rest. Before I know it, I am high above the meadow, drifting with the clouds.</p>
<p>Someone knocking on the door awakens me. It is my new manager. There is always another manager, someone else to hold meetings, give projects, and assign deadlines. It is inescapable. He wants to talk to me, congratulate me on my promotion.</p>
<p>\"Hey Bill, I know you just got here, but get that assessment into me by Thursday, okay?\"</p>
<p>\"Yeah, sure,\" I reply.</p>
<p>The door closes.</p>
<p>I look back to the pencil holder, once more. I place it inside a drawer, where it cannot be seen. The drawer closes with a final click. I turn to the computer and pull out my new papers. There is always more work to be done.</p>
<p>As the day goes on, I become weary of the tedious work. Glancing down through the window onto the street, I observe people passing by, their size miniscule from here. They walk busily, some carrying briefcases, others playing with one another. Absorbed in their own paths, they pass each other by without speaking. They walk along the straight lines of the sidewalk, turning only when their paths dictate so. I look back down to the paper... and see an ant.</p>
<p>I am instantly reminded of my nightmare and scoot back quickly in my chair, ready to kill it before it grows. Except this time there is no box of tissues. My initial fear of seeing the ant slowly fades, as I notice it also seems to have purpose. Instead of wandering aimlessly about the surface of the desk, it travels in a straight line. Suddenly curious, I decide to watch its path. The ant walks across the desk, climbing down the leg at the end, continuing along the corner of the wall. It makes it way around the room, walking steadily but not in any particular rush. As it nears the end of the wall, its path begins to curve upwards. It seems now to quicken, to know that its goal is within reach. I finally realize it is headed for the window overlooking the street. It climbs over the sill of the window, and finds a small crack in the sealing along the edge. It squeezes itself through, and -just like that- is gone. I try opening the window, only to find that it has no latch. Disappointed, I sit back down at my desk. There is nothing I can do. The ant is gone, escaped from my cramped cell. I turn back to the papers on my desk, the black words sitting like ants upon the white surface. I wait, half wishing the words to crawl from the paper. Seeing nothing, I begin to type, sighing.</p>
