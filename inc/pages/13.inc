<?php$aid = 'ruchi';$title = 'Memoirs of a Geisha';$cid = c7;$issueid = i1;$body = "<p>Arthur Golden's <u>Memoirs of a Geisha</u> is easily one of the more poignant novels I have read recently. It circles around a young girl, Sayuri, taken from her elder sister, Satsu, who learns to become a geisha. At first Sayuri is reluctant to learn anything about Kyoto and becoming a geisha, and attempts to run away. Upon discovering her sister is a prostitute, she is in shock and is quickly caught and forced to relinquish her training rights, instead becoming a servant in her pleasure house. Here she is abused and told how much she owes her house and family. Eventually, she is once again sponsored by Mahema, though, and becomes a successful geisha, more so than her nemesis, Hatsumomo and her friend Pumpkin. She quickly falls in love, but is forced to put her emotions aside for her job. Over time, she grows up both emotionally and sexually, from the time she feels desire, to sexual fear, to actual sex itself. She experiences conflicting loyalties, betrayals of her best friend, and the hatred of a ruthless enemy. </p><p>When I read this book, I had a hard time putting it down. Golden captures Sayuri's emotions quite bluntly, at times portraying her as a seductress who is about to go against all the rules of being a Geisha, and at other times a blushing girl who misunderstood a stare. Sayuri's hardships, and her triumphs and losses surrounding them, are almost addicting. Her relationships are as complex as ours, and not at all idealized or dramatized as most authors tend to do.</p><p>Nobu and Sayuri's relationship, in contrast with the Chairman, allow us to glimpse a difference between true love and friendship, loyalties and the conflicting desires. Suddenly, relationships as they were when she was eleven years old, Sayuri realizes.</p><p>Mahema is the mother figure in this novel. Make no mistake - no matter how unsympathetic she may be, she cares for Sayuri and works to make her life easier, calling in favors and spoiling her with gifts. When Sayuri is forced to betray her, she has a hard time speaking to Mahema and breaks down in tears. Mahema is the only reason Sayuri succeeds, and more often than not Sayuri turns to her when in need.</p><p>I couldn't help but love this book just for her relationships with people. They seemed so real and so possible, I felt I could really appreciate them. Even when Sayuri begins to age and experiences desire and sex, I could sympathize with her. She seems so human, with likes and dislikes, and her obvious discomfort with something she didn't feel ready for, that I couldn't help but love her. She could relate to anyone, of any age or gender.</p><p>My only problem with this book was at times, I wasn't quite sure what Sayuri was thinking. I would know who she loved, and who she just regarded as a father or a friend, and I'd watch her interaction with them. However, when each of them, in turn, made overtures to her, I didn't know what ran through her head. I just knew if she accepted, rejected, or asked them to wait. Also, at some points, I would have definitely appreciated less detail, or for the scene to just be cut out.</p><p>Sayuri emotionally and sexually matures, and you can see every step of this. However, just because the focus of the book is a woman, doesn't mean this book isn't meant for guys. As a matter of fact, I would suggest everyone to read this. It gives unique insight on the finer aspects of growing up and maturing, as well as teasing your imagination and provoking thought. Plus, you learn some amount of history from it, and you get to see the experiences of a Japanese entertainer.</p>";include ($Server_incRoot . 'authors/' . $aid . '.inc');?>
