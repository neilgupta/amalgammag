<p>OH MY GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE RUTHLESS REVIEWS DIDN'T PUT THIS ON THEIR <a href=\"http://www.ruthlessreviews.com/80saction/80saction.html\">80'S ACTION GUIDE</a>.</p>

<p>Well, I guess I'll do it for them. Again, in their trademarked 80's action movie style.</p>

<p>Raymond remembers his childhood...</p>

<p><b>Tagline:</b><br/>
The man with the hat is back. And this time, he's bringing his Dad.</p>

<p><b>Entire Story In Fewer Words Than Are In This Sentence:</b><br/>
Indiana Jones looks for the Holy Grail.</p>

<p><b>Homoeroticism:</b><br/>
None really. Indiana Jones is as straight as a line. Sure, the movie is focused on a guy-guy relationship, but it's father and son, and I don't think Spielberg would go that far in terms of gayness.</p>

<p><b>Corpse Count:</b><br/>
I got 36, which isn't really a lot. But this is a family action movie, so I guess such a low corpse count is acceptable. Hmmm... Maybe I'm beginning to get why ruthless reviews didn't put this in there.</p>

<p><b>Post-Mortem One Liner:</b><br/>
Well, Indiana and his dad get into a little argument, and Dr. Jones senior calls Indiana \"Junior.\" Our great Indiana Jones hates being called this wussy name. Oh, I forgot to mention that they get into this argument WHILE being held up at gunpoint by 3 Nazis. After Dr. Jones senior utters this horrible word, Indiana screams:<br/>
<br/>
Jones: I TOLD YOU...<br/>
(Grabs machine gun from Nazi 1, beats Nazi 1 in the head with it, and then machine guns down Nazi 2 and Nazi 3)<br/>
Jones: DON'T CALL ME JUNIOR!</p>

<p>Great stuff. And then his dad, stunned, exclaims, \"Look what you just did!\" Hilarious stuff.</p>

<p>But an even better one is where:</p>

<p>(SPOILER ALERT)</p>

<p>The main villain finds the lair where the dozens of grails lie. Also, there is Indiana, some Nazi chick, and a knight. The knight explains that the true grail will bring you eternal life while a false one will kill you. Well, the villain chooses one of the false ones, and oh boy, does he die. I mean, his skin literally dissolves. The knight, upon seeing this guy die a horrible (and probably painful) death, stoically and silently says:</p>

<p>Knight: He chose... poorly.</p>

<p>Haha, his delivery of that line is classic.</p>

<p><b>Novelty Death:</b><br/>
Well, the ones above were pretty cool, but I'm more partial towards the scene where there are three Nazis standing in a line. Indiana Jones whips out a pistol and shoots the first one. The bullet passes right through all three of them. And the way they fall over is just hilarious. 3 guys with one bullet = = CLASSIC. Almost as classic as that part in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Jones shoots the guy with a sword.</p>

<p><b>How Bad Is It Really?:</b><br/>
This movie rules. I just watched it again yesterday, and it still rocks. The scenes between Indiana and his dad are hilarious, as are almost all the other scenes in this movie. This movie works really well as both a comedy and an adventure film, and it never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously, like The Da Vinci Code. For example, Indiana and his dad are tied up back to back in chairs. Indiana asks his dad to take out a cigarette lighter and try to burn the ropes off. However, the dad drops the lighter, which is still flaming. The dad starts trying to blow out the flame, but inadvertently causes the carpet to catch fire. The fire then spreads to a nearby chair, which then causes the table to catch fire. Soon, the entire room is on fire as Indiana and his dad try to escape, still tied to chairs. Now, it takes imagination to think up a scene where Indiana and his father are trying to escape from a burning room while tied up in chairs, but it takes major skill to come up with the events that build up to that scene. Simply ingenious.</p>

<p>This movie has everything, romance (sort of), action, tanks, explosions, supernatural elements, and, of course, Nazis. You never get tired of seeing those Nazis getting butchered. More butchering would've been awesome, but Spielberg decided to make this more family oriented. It still rocks though.</p>

<p><b>Stupid Political Content:</b><br/>
Well, the baddies are Nazis, but the movie is more of a spiritual movie than a political movie. The Nazis are just typical baddies because nobody important cares if they die or are murdered at random intervals.</p>

<p><b>What You Learned:</b><br/>
I dunno... Indiana Jones rocks? But I knew that before...</p>
