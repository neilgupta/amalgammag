<p>On June 9th, the World Cup 2006 opened with a match between Germany and Costa Rica, but the biggest story at this year's cup is that of violence. The racist element of soccer in Europe could be coming to a head. Also, fear of terrorist attacks is huge at the cup this year. However, the \"beautiful game\" goes on, and as per usual Brazil is favored to win it big. With the best player in the world playing for them in Ronaldinho, Brazil has another advantage of being the most feared team in any given World Cup. I believe that Brazil will have trouble and probably lose to Thierry Henry and the French national team, because Henry will be hungrier than ever after losing the UEFA Champions League final to Ronaldinho and the Barcelona team. The French team wants to prove itself after a miserable performance in the '02 Cup. Henry's style of fast-break soccer is comparable to Brazil's, and because of that, his team must adapt to the style. The U.S. is not expected to go far because of their opening group, the \"group of death\", Italy, the Czech Republic, and Ghana, but in my opinion they will emerge from their group, but will eventually lose to a team like England.</p>

<p>While the world watches the World Cup, the U.S. will be watching the NBA Finals where Dallas and Miami each look to capitalize on their first Finals appearance. After dropping the first game in Dallas, Shaq and Dwayne Wade want to win game 2 so that they can take home-court advantage from Dallas, but that could be difficult considering that Dallas's star Dirk Nowitzki was not the leading scorer for them. Dallas is using its deep bench and speed to win the game, and after their impressive run to the Finals, taking out the defending champions, they appear to be the favorites in the Finals, but Shaq will take over the series and Miami will arise as champions for the first time.</p>
