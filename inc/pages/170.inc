<p>It was a long 13 years in prison. I vividly remember the trial: the police listing every amount of circumstantial evidence against me, the judge falling asleep during the trial, and my mother-in-law screaming at me for being a terrible person. I have no idea who murdered my wife and infant daughter. I simply walked into my house and saw their heads bashed to bits with a baseball bat. The police thought that I killed her because I had blood on my pants, even though it was only because I was only kneeling over her body, mourning the fact that I had lost both the love of my life and my only daughter. My lawyer was pretty stupid as well. He defended horribly. He could not cross-examine for his life, his closing statement was the most pathetic speech I have ever witnessed next to the President\'s State of the Union address; he merely said "If you have any doubt that my client is innocent, find him so. Otherwise, do what is just." HUH? What kind of defense attorney was he? The stupid jury found me guilty and sentenced me to 25 to life, even though there was literally no evidence for a conviction. The prosecution\'s argument was basically that I was found with blood on my pants and that my fingerprints were everywhere. It didn\'t even occur to the jury that my fingerprints were there because she was murdered in MY HOUSE, where I happen to LIVE. The prosecution also made a big deal about how I accidentally killed a woman 3 years before. Not only was that irrelevant to the case, it wasn\'t even my fault. I was driving down the road when some woman ran in front of my car. I tried stopping, but my brakes didn\'t work very well and I ended up running her over. The prosecutor kept saying that if I was able to kill an innocent woman then, I\'m still very able and willing to kill an innocent woman now. Seriously, he actually managed to sway the jury with that bogus argument. Well, anyways, I ended up getting sent to Richter\'s Island Penitentiary to live out my sentence.</p>
<p>Prison life was one of the worst things I have ever experienced. I was the worst thing you could be there: white and small. I got beaten daily by both prison guards and inmates, and whenever I fought back, I ended up being the one getting put into solitary confinement. The one good thing that happened in prison was when I got a new cellmate after the first 5 years of my long sentence. His name was John, and he was apparently sentenced to life without parole for murder. He told me that he made the victim kneel down blindfolded as he pulled out a shotgun and blew the back of his head out. But he was extremely kind and amicable to me. He taught me how to stand up against the prison bullies. I got into many more fights, but I managed to do more damage than I used to before getting put into solitary confinement again. When I was in the dark room, I would think about two things. One, of course, was what new things I could do with John once I got out. However, I never forgot about how my wife was brutally murdered, and I vowed to find the man who did it and to kill him. He ruined my life. He took away my one true love, got me stuck in some prison where I\'d get beaten everyday, and forced me to seek solace with a criminal that I barely knew. My chance to live up to this promise arose when John started a prison riot. He managed to get all the inmates to steal some weapons to beat up the guards and escape. The guards retaliated with machine guns, with many inmates dying left and right. At first, I was too scared to even leave my cell, but John eventually dragged me out and helped me finally escape. As the prison was located on an Island, I dove into the ocean and swam ashore. I then went to the nearest bank. I remembered my cousin\'s bank account number and password, so I managed to withdraw $1,000 for food and shelter. I then went to the nearest motel, where I got a room and slept.</p>
<p>Later that night, the phone rang. I picked it up: "Hello?"</p>
<p>"Don\'t hang up the phone," replied a deep, whispering voice.</p>
<p>Shocked, I immediately asked, "Who are you?"</p>
<p>The guy laughed, saying "You won\'t believe how hard it was: convincing the police you murdered your wife, getting your lawyer to defend you horribly, getting you the worst possible judge, swaying the jury against you, getting you into the worst possible prison. Very expensive."</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>
<p>He laughed: "Does the name Alicia Gaston mean anything to you?"</p>
<p>It did. She was the woman I accidentally ran over with my car.</p>
<p>"My mother came up to me after the trial, enraged at the "not guilty" verdict. She made me swear to bring my sister\'s killer to justice. She made me swear to make that man suffer, so what better thing to do than frame him for his family\'s murder. That way, you take away both his family and his life. You want to know who I am? Turn around."</p>
<p>I turned around and saw John walk into the room, cocking a shotgun. Of course, it was John Gaston, a billionaire businessman. It made sense; he is the only one around who can afford to bribe so many policemen, judges, and jurors. "On your knees," he commanded. Stunned, I kneeled down and asked, "You killed my wife?" "No," he responded, "I hired some hobo to do that. I realized, however, that it would be easier to watch you in prison if I were there personally myself, so I killed him and turned myself in." He smirked: "Then I realized how painful it would be knowing that you\'ve been friends with your family\'s killer for 8 years, that you missed every chance to avenge their deaths during that time, which is why I helped you escape. I wanted to lure you here so I could tell you the complete truth before killing you." He laughed as he stuck the shotgun to the back of my head and fired.</p>
