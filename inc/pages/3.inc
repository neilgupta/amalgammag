I want your musical voice to keep my ear drums vibrating like a tuningfork. I have grown your favorite roses in my garden so that their smell willkeep on entering my nasal passage and the charming color of their corollareminds me of your cheeks and lips. The enchanting color of your iris attractsme like an electron which is attracted to nucleus but the fear of your fatherrepels me with equal force. Yesterday your presence in the party made my heartbeat at the rate of 172 beats/sec. The velocity of my blood flow increased atthe rate of 15m/sec. and became 80m/sec.Your personality attracted me like thecentripetal force but the medulla oblongata of my brain compels me to convert thiscentripetal force into centrifugal force and now I am revolving around yourhouse like an electron in its orbit. Whenever I see your father a wave of fearhaving simple harmonic motion passes through my vertebral column and my heartbeats are reduced to one half of the original. At the moment, a covalent bondhaving sigma orbital exist between us. But in the future I hope it will bechange into an ionic bond.<br><br>As to every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore , I hopeu too love me with the same magnitude of love. <br>In the end your affection is directly to the product of our love and inverselyproportional to the square of your fathers hate.<br>Your affection = (constant) your love * my love /(ur fathers hate)2 <br>EQUATION:-<br>A=K L1L2/(H)2 <br>From your gravitational pull";include ($Server_incRoot .
