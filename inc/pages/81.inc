<p>The television is turned on to the news in the adjoining apartment. The anchorwoman sings, \"La deed a deed a deed a deed a!\" Hoping that I'm mishearing, I listen more attentively. The melody only recurs. A horn blares. I scurry to the children's bedroom, where I find ten clenched, wrenching little hands protruding beneath the bed sheet. I am apprehensive to call the boys out from under the bed, because I know I will be confronted by fear dripping from ten little eyes. Soon the horn's sound disappears, and the street outside is drenched in deafening silence, stopped emotion. Urgently, I delve beneath the bed and whisper, \"Stay here, until the radio plays something familiar.\" Soon, I am darting out the door, down the stairs, and into the street.</p>
<p>On the roads, the recruited men are parading around, wretched, retching on all fours. By the grocer's, I notice Corporal Bradley of regiment five standing in proud array among the soldiers.  With the arrival of militants, the din and locomotion resume. <i>America,</i> I think, <i>the land of the free.</i> I amble through the decay searching for any antidote for my anguish, any place where I can find solace and relief for my children. The hollow memory of my husband haunts my mind. <i>If only he were here,</i> I reminisce. It takes immense self-discipline to keep from mentally reliving his departure; I force myself out of my reverie and focus upon the task at hand. <i>I must find a safe haven.</i></p>
<p>I saunter towards the river on the east side of town where I know a boat is waiting. Wary of attracting attention, I stealthily duck behind the collapsed pillars and rubble that litter the street. Unfortunately, my camouflage is not effective enough to conceal me from the obtrusive eyes of a militant standing guard outside the Russian embassy's gates. He calls out to me, \"Hey, woman! Where do you think you're going?\" I am not graceful at handling confrontation, and my heart flutters wildly. I feel dizzied, acrid vomit threatening to explode from my gut.</p>
<p>Immediately words sputter from my mouth. \"To the grocery store,\" I shout, \"to pick up some milk.\" I clench my lips shut for fear of uttering more words and arousing suspicion.</p>
<p>\"Didn't you hear the siren?\" the guard inquires.</p>
<p>\"No,\" I state, unsteadily. I elaborate and proclaim, \"You see, I must wear a hearing aid; I'm short of hearing. And now, you see, I've lost it! So I couldn't hear the sounds.\"</p>
<p>Suddenly, I realize my mistake, and pray that the guard is incompetent and doesn't notice that I am clearly hearing him from across the street. By a rare stroke of luck, the guard loses attention in my words and quickly leaps to a new inquiry.</p>
<p>\"Why are you out here alone? You indecent wench, where is your husband? Look at you, you filthy woman, have you no respect for yourself? Can't you dress like a decent woman? Have you no faith in God? Go to hell.\"
<p><i>No,</i> I think. <i>No! God will bring peace.</i></p>
<p>\"I'm sorry, sir,\" I yelp, \"I must be on my way.\" I strain to speak with firm conviction to disguise the trembles in my voice. Without pausing for his reply, I resume my journey through the ravaged streets. <i>God will bring peace, God will bring peace, God will bring peace.</i> I recite these words as I walk, hoping they may assuage the distress that strangles my hope. In my mind, I conjure a clear image of the boat positioned under the overgrowth of the river reeds, hidden from intrusive eyes. I focus upon this clear goal to inspire my legs to move stealthily. I remind myself that by the boat, there is a wrinkle in the river where the wind blows so sweetly. I beg myself to remember fortuitous times, the memories drawing upon what little strength I still possess.</p>
<p><i>We lay upon the mattress and tumbled to sleep. Our child lay plump and healthy, nestled peacefully in our arms. My eyes close, a contented smile mingling upon my lips. Gracefully, I drift into unconsciousness.</i></p>
<p><i>It was a day of ideal weather. The grass shone of faultless sun, and the wind blew impeccable golden leaves across the endless path before us. The boys sauntered ahead, their faces round with delight, hopping among the brush, upturning mounds of leaves upon each other in innocent amusement. Our fingers intertwined, we strolled leisurely behind them, keeping a lazy, watchful eye.</i></p>
<p><i>The rain beat down upon the asphalt outside as I stood at the prison steps, begging the guards to let me see you one more time. In the early morning, shortly after midnight, they relented against my iron will, and ushered me into an empty, barren room. Blindfolded, I sat waiting for you. Every so often I heard muted footsteps approaching from the corridor. My heart would beat wildly, wishing to see you one last time. Thinking the guards were playing a cruel joke, I became disheartened, presuming they had only conjured a new way to torment me. Suddenly, two guards opened the door and tread inside. They ushered you between them and strode forward to remove my blindfold. You were dressed in your best suit.</i></p>
<p><i>\"I've done nothing wrong,\" you proclaim.</i></p>
<p><i>\"I know,\" I reply. \"I know you haven't. The children know. Why... why?\" Fully aware this is my last conversation with you, I disregard the guards at the door and speak freely, my heart open and wild.</i></p>
<p><i>Suddenly the guards grab hold of your arms and drag you from the room. They return shortly only to replace the blindfold upon my tearstained eyes and escort me from the jail into the parking lot. The minute I reach my car, however, a blast echoes in the sky, and the rain falls harder than ever before.</i></p>
<p>A few steps further and I reach the river bank. My eyelids droop to a close, the curtains of my stage drawing together. First, my knees buckle, sinking into the mud beside the stream. My torso falls forward, my back refusing the support a soulless cavity, an empty human form. The wind ripples in a plaintive melody, a truncated symphony. I bury my head between my knees, my own pungent vomit coming ashore.</p>
