<p>\"Max, Chloe, get out of bed! We have to leave in a few minutes!\"</p>
<p>Two children, half-asleep, fumbled around clanging loudly, while a rushed mother hurried them. The two wolfed down their breakfast, listening to the multitude of sounds filling the air: screams from their frustrated mother, melodic songs from the birds outside, and the whoosh of cars on the distant freeway. Finally, a bright neon green car shot out of the garage and disappeared over the horizon. That was the start of another hectic day in the life of the Capertin family as they prepared for their trip to Princeton.</p>
<p>Being a mere seventh grader, Max led a carefree life, but his sister, a graduating senior, dragged him along to her college orientation at Princeton. Her whole family had been so excited at her acceptance, and they were delighted to accompany her on her first visit. Max, on the other hand, was quite apathetic and disappointed because he was wasting his spring break on this dreary trip that would cost him an episode of his favorite television series. He had finished his moping, though, and had accepted his obligation, assuring himself that he could make it interesting. After a short five hour plane flight, the family arrived in New Jersey and breathed in the crisp east coast air.</p>
<p>At breakfast the next day, the previous morning's routine ensued again. After eating breakfast in the hotel's dining area, Max, Chloe, and their parents hailed a taxi and headed for the campus to observe the ambience. At first glance, Max gasped at the overwhelmingly colossal structures. Then, he grinned mischievously, thinking up grand plans of exploration.</p>
<p>\"Max, stay close to us, okay?\" commanded his father.</p>
<p>\"No!\" he screamed to himself inwardly. His designs were all destroyed, so he gloomily followed his parents, waiting for an opportunity to escape. Finally, his chance appeared. After watching him stalk around for some time, his parents finally grew weary of his behavior and allowed him to run off.</p>
<p>\"I'm free!\" Max yelled as he darted into the largest building he could find, visiting each of the rooms. Many of them contained heavy machinery or what looked to be fragile objects. Thus, he shied away from them, always remembering what his mother once told him, \"Never touch things that look dangerous, or you could end up paying a hefty price.\"</p>
<p>At the end of the hallway, though, there was an empty room. Max became ecstatic upon finding the ideal space in which he could stay. Pulling a ball out of his backpack, he began to play, without watching the time. The sun soon set, and, before he knew it, someone came and locked the door. Too involved in the excitement of his toys, Max did not notice that he had been locked in. When he eventually tired of playing by himself and tried to leave, he discovered that he could not get out and began to panic. Sweat cascaded down his face as he ran in circles screaming incoherently.</p>
<p>\"Ah! Someone get me out of here! Is anyone there? Hello?\" he screamed over and over again, pounding on the door, certain that someone would come for him, but there was no one who could hear him. His desperate pleas for help failing, Max looked around trying to find a way out. The windows were sealed shut and the ventilation ducts were too high. As the darkness and silence seeped into the room, he began groping around for anything. Completely devastated and hopeless, he collapsed in a corner of the room, sobbing.</p>
<p>\"I'm all alone. Everyone left me. I'm going to be stuck here forever with only these things to keep me company,\" he thought to himself. \"They've probably all already forgotten about me.\" Unable to sleep, Max paced around the room restlessly, thinking about what had happened that day. After realizing his mistake of intensely wishing to leave, he settled down, promising to become a better son who would please everyone. Gradually tiring of his speculations, he drifted off into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>Upon opening his eyes, Max perceived his mother standing before him. His face lit up with joy as he flashed a bright smile at her, and they walked hand in hand through the campus in the shade of the trees. After a hug and a few words, she walked off, smiling and waving.</p>
<p>\"No, don't leave!\" Max yelled out as he woke up. He looked around himself, recalling his surroundings. A dim, lifeless light descended through the windows from the gloomy clouds. Tears once again began streaming down the child's face as he solemnly remembered the fond memories of his family.</p>
<p>Just as he was setting his head down on the floor, a bright light flashed through the door. Max's eyes lit up with new hope as he sprang up, pounding heavily on the thick metal door and shouting until there was no air left in his lungs. Finally, a confused face appeared before him, stared at him, shocked, and then left. Believing that he had once again been abandoned, Max dejectedly slumped to the floor, waiting for it all to end. Luckily, it would only be a short while before the man returned with the key to the door. As soon as the door opened, Max gleefully rolled onto his back, his frown instantly changing into a wide grin. The man chuckled as he dragged Max onto his feet and took him to the office where his mother was waiting.</p>
<p>\"Mommy, I missed you so much! I thought you had abandoned me! I was so scared in that room all by myself. I thought you left me there forever. I would've died without you!\" choked the boy through a thick veil of tears. \"I'll never leave you again.\"</p>
