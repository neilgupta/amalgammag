<p>From childhood, most of us without lactose-intolerance have been told to drink our milk. From a warm beverage meant to induce sleep to a revered "formula" for upward growth, milk is considered a necessary staple accepted by all as the ultimate source of calcium and vitamin D. However, most of us aren\'t aware that milk has inherent properties that are in fact, negative for our bodily health.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that milk and dairy products produce mucus which increases frequency of colds and flues, any vitamin content or nutritional value from milk is already reduced by one half during the process of pasteurization, which strips away beneficial bacteria and enzymes. What is left is an enzyme of which 40% survives the process of pasteurization. This enzyme, xanthine oxidase, attaches itself to fat molecules in the milk which, through the process of homogenization, become small enough to enter the bloodstream through the intestinal wall. Once the fat molecules are in the bloodstream, arteries can become hardened and even blocked. Why then the process? Pasteurization allows the shelf life of milk to extend from five days to several weeks, and allows the farmers to have lower standards of cleanliness, since farmers providing raw milk must adhere to higher and stricter standards of sanitation. On top of growth hormones and antibiotics used to treat cows, the processing of milk is fairly frightening.</p>

<p>A common myth is that milk, rich in calcium, builds your bones. In reality, an excessive intake of milk, a form of animal protein, forms acid in the bloodstream during digestion. To neutralize the acid, the bones - storing 99% calcium, 85% phosphorus, and 60% magnesium - are broken down in order to release calcium into your blood. Contrary to what the milk ads suggest - which, interestingly, are ad campaigns of the milk industry, not government sponsored, like most of the public believes - drinking processed milk depletes calcium in the bones, rather than strengthening them.</p>
<p>While milk does offer calcium, the amount that becomes available to the rest of the body through digestion suggests that it\'s not worth the negative side affects - after all, osteoporosis and bone fractures are uncommonly high in the US, despite our status as the leading consumption of milk and dairy products. Rather than drinking milk excessively for calcium, incorporating green leafy vegetables, extracted fruit and vegetable juices, especially carrots, and vitamin supplements for vitamin D into your diet will provide better overall results for your general health and appearance.</p>
