<p>\"Please, let them save me,\" I thought numbly as my feet padded along the corridor to the heavy oak doors. With a push from one of the two men holding onto my arms, the doors swung open and I was dragged into the courtroom. The first thing I noticed was that no one was sitting on my side of the room. No prosecution team stood before the judge, but the other side of the room was packed with people.</p>
<p>The room was very hot. Fidgeting in the stand, I rubbed my sweaty palms together and looked out over the jury. Classmates, teachers, old friends and his family sat on the wooden benches, staring straight at me and occasionally turning to one another to gossip.</p>
<p>There in the front row, sitting next to a brunette woman with glasses was him, the blight of my existence. Luckily, he was not looking at me, at least, not yet. A movement to my right drew my attention to the rising chairman. Standing upright, I wiped my hands on my jeans, trying to get rid of the infernal fear on my palms.</p>
<p>\"Do you swear that the testimony you will give before this court will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\" the chairman asked, holding his hand parallel to mine. I nodded, throat dry, before croaking out a mumbled \"Yes.\"</p>
<p>\"Have you reached a unanimous agreement on the verdict?\" the judge asked the foreman, a cruel looking man with hawk-like eyes and very dark hair.</p>
<p>\"We have, your honor. Miss Vernon, we have reviewed your request for a restraining order against your father on numerous accounts of sexual harassment and after examining the evidence given by the witness on your behalf and what we extracted from you during our interrogations, we have come to a conclusion that- \" the foreman stated before the judge cut him off.</p>
<p>\"The verdict, Wilson,\" he cut in sharply. Scowling at the rotund judge, Wilson muttered his response into the judge's ear. Feeling my legs involuntarily begin to shake, I clenched and unclenched my fists in terrified anticipation as I watched a small sneer of approval mar the judge's face. Hope ballooning in my chest, I looked over to my father, elation rushing through my veins. I was going to be free of this mess once and for all.</p>
<p>\"Your request has been denied, Miss Vernon,\" the judge announced. Loud whispers erupted across the room and the balloon in my chest burst into a thousand tiny pieces. \"Furthermore, the opportunity for an appeal has been revoked and the jury has decided that forced habitation would be best suited to your particular situation...\"</p>
<p>I did not hear the rest of the judge's sentence because all of the blood had drained from my head. Forced habitation. How could they? How could the legal system condemn me to this prison? They were supposed to protect me, not put me in a place that I would rather die than return to.</p>
<p>\"W-wait,\" I quailed, my voice quivering as I attempted not to sob in front of all these people I cared about and respected. \"You can't do that. I told you what happened, and you're making me go back...\" By now, tears were falling and I had stepped forward to the edge of the witness stand. The foreman sent a nasty sneer my way, and the judge merely arched an eyebrow. Leaning forward, he surveyed me critically for a moment.</p>
<p>\"Do not think that some melodramatic show of emotion will sway our decision, Miss Vernon. Your father warned us during his interrogation that you had a tendency for needless theatrics, and an attempt to change the jury's vote through this brand of nonsense will only increase the length of your future familial interactions,\" he stated calmly, as though discussing the outcome of a soccer match.</p>
<p>As I began pacing like a caged tiger, the two men behind me exchanged glances before moving forward to try and restrain me in the event I did something rash. The foreman, however, living up to his harsh appearance, smiled at me, giving me a piercing, almost demonic look.</p>
<p>\"A police car will now escort you to your new home,\" he articulated softly as I stiffened up. Applying pressure on my arms, the men tried to move me from the stand, but panic and hysteria had taken over all my other thoughts. Hurling myself in the opposite direction, I struggled hopelessly as my feet scraped across the polished wooden floor.</p>
<p>\"No! You can't, it's not fair, I can't live with him forever!\" I sobbed, vaguely aware that a few of my classmates were laughing at me. \"I didn't lie!\"</p>
<p>\"The case is closed, Miss Vernon. Court adjourned,\" proclaimed the judge, banging his gavel a few times on the table. I sank to my knees and the men behind me impatiently yanked me backwards, toward the police car, towards a case I should have won, toward Hell itself.</p>
<p>Kicking and flailing wildly, I tried to free myself, but it was useless; I had lost, the case was closed. The last thing I saw as the oak doors closed was the defense side, laughing and applauding, and <i>his</i> face, twisted with a smile that sent an ice cold bolt of horror down through to my toes.</p>
<p>And then I was outside, and the police car was drawing closer as I was \"escorted\" to it. When the car door swung open, I snapped back to my senses and began revolting with full force - my last stand against a corrupt evil. Yet it was not enough to save me, and a minute later, I was sitting handcuffed in the back of the car.</p>
<p>Waves of nausea crashed down over me as the policeman drove into the driveway I had tried to erase from my memory. Deadened to outside noise, I watched as a car drove up and my father got out and shook hands with the police man. The handcuffs were taken off and my father led me into the kitchen.</p>
<p>\"Kneel,\" he commanded, smiling triumphantly as my knees gave way. Eyes roving around the room, I noticed with shock that a small gun was on the counter. Again, sound disappeared as my father rattled on. Deciding to take advantage of his lack of concentration, I leapt up and snatched the gun, holding it to my temple and backing up slowly.</p>
<p>\"Put that down,\" my father ordered sharply, freezing as I jerked my hand a little. I shook my head, beginning to laugh shrilly.</p>
<p>\"Is this my fate, to be blackmailed and tortured because otherwise you would shoot me? No, you would never do that,\" I said to no one in particular. My stability was long gone, and death was a much more preferable choice than psychological and sexual assault. Looking up at him, finally meeting the gaze of the unfeeling blue eyes, I smiled.</p>
<p>\"You didn't win,\" I whispered, an insane grin lighting my face, my desire to live freely completely overpowered by desperation and an ever-increasing madness.</p>
<p>A mourning dove flew out of the yew tree in the front yard as the gunshot echoed through the quiet neighborhood. Opening the front door, I stuck the empty gun into my jacket pocket and walked down the street.</p>
