<p>At night, most children sleep curled upon colorful bedspreads with a teddy bear under their arm. Some fantasize about light and dancing birds; some shiver at the thought of dark clouds and black crows; some sleep peacefully, with no dreamy thoughts running through their head. These kids wake up in the morning, stretch a little bit, yawn, and concentrate to recollect the adventure of the night before. But I live in a nightmare; and every waking moment, I fear.</p>
<p>\"Moe, wake up! It's your first day of Sunday school with the big kids!\" I am already awake with my teeth brushed. Mom walks into my room with my church clothes and shoes. I tear off my Ninja Turtle pajamas and jump in to the freshly ironed suit. It smells sharp and sweet. I take a big whiff and stifle a little sneeze.</p>
<p>\"I sprayed some of your daddy's cologne onto it,\" she whispers, \"It's our secret okay?\" I nod eagerly, run to the kitchen, grab a toast, and hop into my mom's car. Usually I sit in the back seat, but today is an exception as this is my first day as a big kid. My dad groans as he climbs into the back.</p>
<p>\"It's okay daddy, I'll take care of mommy,\" I proudly say.</p>
<p>A few years later I could not keep to my word. I am sitting in front of the television watching Saturday morning cartoons when I hear an ear-splitting howl. I sprint to my parents' bedroom, but the door is locked. I pound on the barrier while I endure more arguing, which is joined by crying. The cries are then replaced by shrill screams. My bawling brother walks up to me, upset by all the noise. I explain that there is a pillow fight and then drag him to the kitchen to feed him ice cream. We talk about the upcoming Power Ranger movie and have a heated debate about the graphics of Pokemon and Digimon. I then take him to the park to shoot some hoops; when we come home my mother is lying in the living room, bruised and drowning herself in alcohol. Daddy is gone. I am tempted to help, but clueless as of what to do.</p>
<p>\"Don't worry Kev; she just lost the pillow fight. She'll cheer up in a bit.\"</p>
<p>\"A bit\" took too long. My mother became addicted to cigarettes and alcohol. She did not attend college, and thus could not successfully support the three of us. We moved into a ghetto area of San Jose, between Twenty-Eighth Street and Kings. While I held my brother's hand on our walks to school, the ragged homeless would extend their bony arms to us. At first, we were shocked and escaped their view; soon we accustomed to these gruesome sights. I would pass bulky, dark-skinned men lounging on the streets during my frequent trips to Seven Eleven (later I would learn that they were smoking marijuana joints). The area was shady, but it was our new home. Our mother applied for minimum paying jobs at a vacuum store during the day and Rite-Aid at night. Kevin and I hardly saw her at home; however, all of us made a weekly thirty-minute commute to our faithful church back in Cupertino.</p>
<p>There were packs of cigarettes and bottles of alcohol littering the house. One day, I brought a pack of cigarettes to school, just for show. Soon students swarmed up to me, offering a dollar for each cigarette. I came home with twenty dollars that day. The next day I returned home with forty dollars. I was making large profits by selling my mom's cigarettes. I feared she would notice, so I sold her beers instead. Each beer brought in five dollars each. By seventh grade, I was a business man.</p>
<p>Outside my window on Kings Street, two older boys always chat and smoke. One usually sports a gargantuan silver medallion and a black ski jacket. The other's signature look is suede Timberland boots and a camouflage print coat. Jealously, I imagine I will be able to buy my own Timberlands some day. Their conversations revolve around the upcoming raves, last night's clubbing experience, and business deals. Every time I eavesdrop, I learn more about night life, marijuana, ecstasy, and cocaine.</p>
<p>One day as I routinely peek through the window, one of the boys catches a glimpse of me. He orders me out, and I obediently listen. The boy in the camouflage jacket sneers at me while flashing his yellow stained teeth. He smells of a mixture of body odor, alcohol, and smoke. Towering above me, he asks if I am interested in \"slanging\" drugs. At first I nervously joke, \"No! It's okay, I go to church, and...\" And what? The church does not pay me to go every week. I certainly do not have many idolizers there either. I dream about the wealth and popularity amongst my peers if I sold illegal, hard-to-get substances. I fear getting caught by the police and disappointing my mother and brother. I imagine my mother's astonishment at her first son bringing home income. Most dominant, however, is the apprehension of what would happen if denied the offer. I reply, \"Yes, sir,\" accompanied by many mixed feelings.</p>
<p>My new job and lifestyle begins this very hour. I climb into the boys' car and await my first job. We park across San Jose State and wait for customers to approach us. A middle aged man strolls up to the driver's seat and casually asks, \"Do you know how to get to HP Pavilion?\" I stifle a chuckle, knowing the arena is a good forty-minute walk. \"Five bucks a pill,\" my 'friend' whispers unexpectedly. My heart starts beating quickly and I feel warmth inside. My new job seems covert and dangerous. I am excited for what the future will bring.</p>
<p>I once was naive, but now I know better. My phone rings five times an hour as I speed around San Jose selling my soul. I am selling my soul because I fear for my life with each bag of cocaine I slang. Before my companions got caught by a police officer, we traveled as a trio. If any customer attempted to assault one of us, another would offer protection. Alone, my merchandise could get stolen; I could get shot, or even killed. One of the biggest ecstasy dealers, I believe his name was Jonathan Park, lost his left arm to the business. Another lost his life.</p>
<p>I routinely parked across the entrance of San Jose State, and casually wait, sipping my Diet Coke. Most people despise the bland aftertaste; for some reason I enjoy it. I take off the cap and chase after the last few drops with my straw. A young man in a white jacket saunters over and casually asks for the directions to the Ringer Cafe on Fourth Street. I smile and ruffle through my compartment. I pull out a half-gram of cocaine in a tightly zipped baggy. \"That'll give you at least seven lines,\" I boast, but my customer seems unimpressed. \"I'll give you at least seven years,\" he growls, pulling out a gun and his badge. \"Put your hands on the wheel. You have the right to remain silent.\"</p>
<p>I am not sure whether I want to call my mother. How can I disappoint her? I slouch in my cell, covered in the bright orange delinquent uniform. My cell mate is engaged in a Bible. With a black, bulky phone in my right hand, I use my left hand to brush my bangs aside. I sigh and murmur, \"Hello mother? This is Moe.\" I apologize and confess my sins, while my cell mate glances up because he can hear my mother's crying from the ear piece. I cannot hide my face, though I am embarrassed. A few hours later I see her red eyes as she bails me out. I thank her. Her lips quiver, but no words are spoken. A lump forms in my throat.</p>
