<?php$aid = 'gwynnie';$title = "Breaking Free of the Overprotective Parent";$cid = c15;$issueid = i1;$body = "<p>How many times have you wanted to go and hang out with your friends, see a late concert, or even just take a walk by yourself, only for your wishes to be shot down by that overprotective parent? Some teens will throw a fit, others will argue, and still others will ask their other parent for permission. While the latter can produce results beneficial to you, your parents will typically end up judging you based on your reaction to their response. </p><p>	Though it is difficult, accepting their answer is the best way to go. Showing that you can be mature in an unfavorable situation often reveals a sense of responsibility, and chances are, your parents will allow you to do what you like the next time you ask. There are a few other steps you can that can help to get you what you want.</p><p>	First off, keep your temper. When you explode at your parents, it sends a message that you are just not mature enough to go out wherever you wish to. If you mention that you'd like to see a movie with friends a week or even a few days ahead of time, this can greatly calm the nerves of an overprotective parent, as springing it on them at the last moment causes needless stress. Of course, there are those last-minute invitations every once in a while, but if you prove that you are responsible, there should be no reason that you won't be allowed to go- after all, your parents were all your age once, and they can identify with you more than you think, scary as it may sound.</p><p>	However, I've found that the best way to convince your parents that yes, going to that Green Day concert is a good idea is to do a mini presentation about it, including times, the people you will be with, where you will be, any necessary contact and transportation information, et cetera. If you show commitment and a desire to include your parents in your plans, then they will feel much more comfortable with allowing you to go. </p><p>	If these steps repeatedly fail, try sitting down and saying that you feel their attitude is unfair, in a way that is not belligerent and will not start off a World War III in your house. Often times, people assume what you are thinking or feeling - we all do presume something incorrect at least once in our lives - so clearing up your position might be enough to persuade them. </p><p>	And for those who are lucky enough to get a \"yes\" when asking our parents- have a good time.</p>";include ($Server_incRoot .
