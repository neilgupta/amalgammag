<p>(AUTHOR'S NOTE: if you do not want to experience the excruciating pain of an acid trip of an intro, skip the first four paragraphs).</p>
<p>Peering over a boulder, Og, shrouded by the night, observes Thak eating a deer. Og spent all day chasing that deer. After much exasperating effort, he had caught and choked the deer until the last bit of life escaped from its fiery nostrils. But when Og left the deer to find one of those magically appearing burning bushes to build a cooking fire, Thak stole the deer and was now thoroughly enjoying the scrumptious meat. The idiot.</p>
<p>Og was angry. He was about to go punch Thak to death, but stopped for a moment. he thought <i>(the following quote was translated from guttural growls and grunts to English in order to facilitate the reader's understanding),</i> \"Hey, I remember when I punched that rock... it hurt! So why don't I take a rock and hit Thak with it?\" Og did just that.</p>
<p>He picked up a nearby rock, and leapt, smashing the rock into Thak's skull. Consequently, red gunk began throbbing out of the fractured remains of poor Thak's cerebrum. Yippy! The concept of a weapon had been discovered! But naturally the rock would not suffice for long. More advanced technology was required to satiate a human's lust for blood. Hence, humans enthusiastically sought and discovered new ways to more effectively kill each other. (About that: the human race seems to be the only species of animals that actively seeks to kill its own members. While lions and monkeys seek to preserve their societies' well being, humans are quite disinterested in that and instead find it more fun to spill their neighbor's guts.)</p>

<p>In any case, the lineage of the weapon was quickly incremented by further novel discoveries by pioneers like Og. The stick can also hurt people! And hey - let's combine the stick and the rock! Hey! We can sharpen the rock and make it more pointy and pokey! Cool! Spears and axes! Neat! Metal is sharper and harder than rock! Shazam, swords! Awesome! These strings I use in my clothing are quite springy when I make them taught! Maybe we can fling stuff with it! Hey, let's call it a bow, and then improve it and call it a crossbow, and then improve it <i>again</i> and call it an arbalest! Word! This TNT stuff is great! It goes boom when I put it on fire - YADDA YADDA YADDA.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the principle behind all guns is to impact a casing of gunpowder to create a high temperature (from friction) collision. The induced heat ignites the powder, initiating a chemical reaction that evolves a large amount of high-energy gas. This gas expands, pushing on anything in its way. So if we lined up a bullet in front of the powder, when the powder is ignited, the gas that forms will push on the bullet, forcing it out the barrel at a tremendous speed. Great - people have taken this concept, and made complex designs of it to make it all \"better.\" And of course these inventions go on to kill countless people. But that aside, gunpowder is messy business. It is costly to fabricate a bullet; you have to tack-weld a sharpened piece of metal to a hollow cylinder filled with powder. Is there another, cheaper way to move that bullet down the barrel? Yes.</p>

<p>Imagine a magnet. Now take a metal (be sure it isn't an antimagnetic metal), and bring it near said magnet. The metal goes <i>on its own</i> toward the magnet. We have all experienced this (and if you haven't, for heaven's sake, get out more). We know that magnets can exert a force on other materials. But the title mentions \"electromagnets.\" Allrighty, so take a wire and pass a current through it and it somehow creates a magnetic field. This is the same kind of magnetic field a magnet has, so it works just the same. Now take three fat wires, but we'll call 'em rails, and put them together in a U shape. Then place a conducting projectile across the two rails that are parallel, and hook the whole shebang to a battery. This creates a circuit. So we now have a current moving through the projectile placed perpendicularly to the two rails. This is the part where we struggle to remember our right hand rules. But I'll spare you the trouble, and tell you the projectile will move along the rails, experiencing a force in that points parallel to the rail (known as the Lorentz Force).</p>

<p>Woohoo! We have the rail gun. If we make the rails long enough, you can take a heavy object and accelerate it to a considerable degree, obtaining muzzle velocities of up to 3500 m/s.</p>

<p>Hokay. Let's take the electromagnetic wire concept and morph it a little. Take the wire and loop it around a metal multiple times. If you pulse a large current through these wires, the changing magnetic field caused by the oscillating current induces something called magnetic flux. Magnetic flux creates an EMF (electromagnetic field). The EMF is directly proportional to the number of loops of wire; the more loops, the stronger the field. EMF's have a lot of potential power - enough to move a bullet. Next, orient the multiple bundles of looped wire into a circular shape (imagine a wagon wheel where the spokes are wrapped with wire, and in the center there is a hole). Imagine a gun where the gun's barrel passes through the hole in the electromagnet. Take a bullet, and put it in the barrel. Then pass a large amount of current through the wires in a very short amount of time (capacitors anyone?). The short burst of current induces an EMF and the bullet will be attracted toward the wire. The force causes the bullet to accelerate through the wire and down the barrel. Voila, we have the gauss gun. Now if we want the bullet to go even faster, we can take multiple coil patterns and place them one after the other in a barrel. Here the timing gets a little tricky because you want to turn on the electromagnets sequentially as the bullet passes through, making sure one magnet does not interfere with another. All in all, we have yet another bullet shot at high speeds, without an iota of gunpowder.</p>

<p>The preceding concepts have enormous potential. Numerous organizations, including the US military, have been researching these weapon designs as possible future replacements for conventional firearms. There are multiple obstacles to be overcome, such as a reliable, steady source of the high ampere current. In the past, the rail gun has seen military service. During World War II, the Germans experimented with rail gun artillery, although it was never exploited as a primary instrument of warfare. They found their designs to be unwieldy; the long cannon barrel rails required a lot of maintenance, making it impractical for battlefield use. In modern days, the United Kingdom's defense research agency has developed a successful rail gun that has been in operation for many years. The gauss gun has been built before by independent research groups, but has yet to be implemented by an army. The advantage a gauss gun has over the rail gun is it's ability to be compact. One could make a gauss gun handgun. In addition, they are easy to make (in other words, I'd gladly make one, if someone funded me... please?). 

<p>In conclusion, the forces exerted by a magnet can be quite potent indeed; potent enough to be used as a weapon. With careful design, one can make a lethal weapon using just a few batteries. If you have questions, and you are too much of a lazy idiot to find the answers yourself, feel free to contact me. Also if you are actually considering funding a gauss gun project, contact me and I will give you a cookie. Or if you want to be selfish, you can make one yourself!
