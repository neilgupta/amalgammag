<p>I\'ve recently heard plenty of speak on NASA, and its ostensible incapacity to do anything. What are they, just a bunch of stuck up government nerds in ties? WRONG, well not all of them at least. Indeed, NASA still has the capacity to do incredible things. The problem is that it has lost the glamour of the 70\'s, the era of the famous "the eagle has landed" (Apollo 11 moon landing and various other moon missions launched afterwards). The 70\'s were the era where technology was the hot new thing. Cell phones just came out, the 747 jumbo-jet got designed, biologists began the efforts of genetic research, etc. The world marveled at this "groovy" new crap that MIT grads were putting together. Nowadays, every hobo on the street totes a cell phone... and for that matter EVERYONE, not only massive corporations, has a computer, and, hell, an iPod. With one of those, we can hear music anywhere, any time. Seriously, hippies had to go all the way to some godforsaken dairy farm in NY to hear music (though Woodstock was the @*#&. Free drugs and sex!).</p>
<p>But, in any case, I believe it is the widespread availability of technology to the general public, which has increased by 200 orders of magnitude, that has caused the disinterest in NASA. Who cares what the smart people with big toys are doing in Moffet Field! We have "myspace"! Its not like they are sending people to the moon anymore, they\'re just doing dumb stuff like taking measurements.</p>
<p>Another factor, in my opinion, is the monkey currently in the oval office. "We will take men to Mars in 2 years. Yes. I like making big statements like that. Makes me feel like Kennedy." Yay, let\'s attempt to improve my public opinion by pulling extreme goals out of my %@$ and saying it on the air. These sorts of moronic notions made by imbecilic republicans (WHO SLASH NASA\'s BUDGET LIKE RETARDS) make people all the more indifferent to what NASA "does."</p>
<p>Au contraire, NASA does do things. Interesting things. First of all, I don\'t mean to be an oldie, but let\'s laud NASA\'s past for a second. Look at your wrist. If you see a digital watch on it, thank the Apollo missions. Have sunglasses? - Also NASA. But nowadays, there are numerous missions conducted by NASA. Missions of exceeding difficulty but of immense importance. Does anyone @#$%-ing remember that there is a @#$ load of ceramic tiles and crystalline gallium arsenide sitting a few hundred miles from earth in orbit?! The thing called the International Space Station? Which is still in progress? And there are people LIVING there? There are multiple experiments carried out there that can be quintessential to human life on earth (osteoporosis research, computer chip technology, etc). Ha. Imagine the implication of the preceding statement. I had to add the "on earth" part to make the distinction that I\'m not referring to human life elsewhere than earth.</p>
<p>Let\'s look at something that may sound familiar. Mars Rovers anyone? Spirit and Opportunity are still in operation on Mars. Take a second to fathom that. I don\'t mean to be a layman, but just consider the fact that from here, we are controlling a robot that is wandering around an alien surface 36 million miles away. And here\'s another mission I found to be particularly impressive: in July, 2005 the "Deep Impact" mission commenced. This mission involved launching a spacecraft the size of an SUV into space, and onboard this craft would be a probe the size of a large coffee table. The idea: fly the space craft by an asteroid moving 1000 mph and fling the probe at it, and smack against the asteroid. It was successful. NASA smashed a probe into the comet’s surface and bored a hole into it. NASA successfully guided a probe on a target moving incomprehensibly fast, in a precise coordinate chosen based on estimated geographic conditions and surface permeability. And guess what? Now we have priceless data pointing toward the beginnings of our universe. Evidence of stuff that happened, oh about 15 billion years ago, stuff like the Big Bang. Hey, biologists, this ones for you. Another one of NASA\'s project is called BEES (Bio-inspired Engineering for Exploration Systems). Scientists looked at bees, and went, hey, how do they know their away around? And studying their brains and their navigational instincts, scientists employed what they learned to try to develop AI to guide craft explore places, via air, autonomously. Besides those recent endeavors, one that has just been launched is a rocket bound for Pluto, and in a few months a satellite will arrive at mars, and it will be the first weather satellite orbiting another planet.</p>
<p>Still not convinced that NASA isn\'t bunk? (Goddamn, I\'m getting tired of typing). NASA does stuff that directly affects you. For example, NASA offers various internship opportunities. However the most prominent program, called SHARP, was recently closed because of lack of funding. (This dearth of money can be resuscitated by increased public attention toward NASA... HINT HINT). Also, NASA is a kind and generous soul! It gives you presents!! Really. I wrote a paragraph and sent it to NASA in a scholarship program, and they sent me a robotics kit, absolutely free. It\'s like those free iPod things except you don\'t have to go through zillions of *@#&%^ pages of ads and crap. Lastly, if you have ever seen a person working with power tools, a computer, or a soldering iron in the vicinity of Room 29, it\'s because of NASA, and it\'s FIRST robotics competition. (Yeah that\'s like the 12495th acronym. It\'s a government agency, what do you expect?)</p>
<p>To conclude (finally), I would like all readers to go to <a href="http://www.nasa.gov">http://www.nasa.gov</a> and look around. You might see something you like. (If you don\'t, I will come and slap you). NASA has done so much for mankind. Only the sky is the limit, psh yeah screw that. Go wherever the hell you want. (Commercial space travel is being explored by NASA). Currently NASA is still active, and has the potential to do so much more. If only they had more. And a way NASA can get this money is if America pays more heed to it. Oh and get the republicans off their #*$&## and have them do something useful with their lives. Seriously, all they want to do with NASA is to put orbital nuclear silos in space. (Though that would be kind of cool.) Consider what I have said (to warrant like the 20 mins I just used up of my precious life).</p>
