<p>AIM. To many parents, these three letters cause a rush of hatred and disappointment to surge through their bodies. According to them, AIM is the ultimate symbol of what is wrong with their children these days. They claim that it distracts the kids from school work and causes people to spend their time chatting and gossiping uselessly. It also supposedly takes away from quality family time. Parents even claim that it hurts children's eyes and that it causes them to be unsociable as they won't leave their chairs, parked in front of computer screens. Well, to all the adults reading, many of us teens feel we deserve a chance to argue our feelings on it. Saying that, here are three reasons AIM is actually a good thing.</p>

<p>Reason 1: AIM actually is a big use for family time.</p>
<p>This is possibly the boldest statement any one has ever made trying to support instant messaging. How can such an isolating program such as AIM ever aid family relations? However, the question commonly coming from us is how does AIM hurt these interactions? Many parents claim that staying in front of the computer all the time hurts family time because teens aren't doing family activities such as eating with the parents or watching TV with relatives. These would be valid points, if they were true.</p>
<p>One of the most common away messages (for those who do not know, these are posts that are left when a user decides to leave but still wishes to receive important messages) is \"out for dinner\" or \"eating.\" So what does this prove? Children still wish to spend quality time eating with their parents. Also, watching TV without speaking is no better than using AIM; sorry, but the television argument is baseless. What about talking with parents? Instant messaging doesn't make children deaf, so kids can still talk to their parents any time they wish to.</p>
<p>OK, so AIM doesn't hurt relations, but that doesn't mean it helps. Well it has the potential to. At a time when divorces are almost as common as marriages, AIM has provided a method for parents across the country to talk, advise, and even yell at their children for hours on end. Don't believe that parents use the abhorrent program, let alone use it as a method to keep in touch with their children? Well I can say this because it happens with one of my friends (who I will keep nameless due to privacy issues, though I am risking my credibility.)</p>
<p>My friend spends much of the time talking to her parents, who are divorced, while doing her homework. But not all of us have divorced parents, so that argument doesn't always work. Therefore, instant messaging doesn't help keep together our families, right?</p>
<p>Tell that to my cousins who live in New York. Many people use this program to stay in touch with distant relatives who they visit rarely; cousins who would otherwise be complete strangers. I myself keep in touch with relatives who live in New York, Connecticut, and Los Angeles through AIM and used it to start talking with a cousin I hadn't spoken to in thirteen years. Thus, it seems that AIM is a way to stay in touch with family as well as friends.</p>

<p>Reason 2: AIM creates a closer community.<p>
<p>I know many of you are laughing at the mere thought that sitting in front of a computer would bring together a community. Well it's true. Ask any teen in the Harker community and they know exactly what I'm talking about. Many parents complain about the driving time going from San Jose to Fremont. They also hate the idea of us clogging up the phone lines or using five hundred minutes every month on our cell phones. At the same time, parents still want us to have friends.</p>
<p>A few years ago, it would have been impossible; however, because of AIM, this is now a reality. Friends that live a half hour away can actually act like friends when they see each other, rather than clueless strangers, due to instant messaging.</p>

<p>Reason 3: AIM actually helps with education.</p>
<p>Okay. So, you've taken note of my argument and hopefully your hatred has softened into at least resentment. But then you look at my last topic and start wondering if you should have even bothered to have read the last few points. Well, before jumping to conclusions, hear me out… I have a basis for this radical idea.</p>
<p>Imagine this situation: You're in the middle of your physics homework and you come to a problem that you have absolutely no idea how to complete. Realizing that there is no way you can figure out the answer without help, you look around and find that your parents are out buying something (or just don't remember how to do the topic). You then turn to your list of phone numbers and search through it until you find the number of your best friend who's in the same class. After dialing the number, you frantically try and copy down your friend's explanation. You hang up the phone and look at the notes you just wrote. The notes turn out to be a jumble of letters that are meaningless. Deciding that trying to listen and jotting notes at the same time won't work, you then try and read your physics book for the fifth time and realize, yet again, that you can't understand anything.</p>
<p>Finally, you realize that you have one more option. You sign on to your AIM account and find your best friend online. There, he is able to describe his advice and since it's already typed out, you can focus on understanding it rather than mindlessly writing notes. You figure out how to solve the problem and finish the rest of your homework.</p>
<p>Getting help on homework is just one example of how useful AIM can be for homework. So you've finished physics homework. You then turn to math homework. After getting all the materials out, you realize your school's server is down. Still signed on to your account, you ask another friend who has already done the homework for the problem set. Yet another problem solved by AIM.</p>
<p>Although this row of situations seems impossible, there are more realistic situations where AIM will help and save time in the busy day of a teenager. It can also be used for tutoring or other helpful activities. So as you see, AIM is not education's enemy; if used correctly (which most teens know how to do), it can be the greatest tool to aid school work.</p>

<p>Now you've seen my arguments and might think that I've wasted too much time trying to convince you about something that you're not going to change your mind about. However, please don't just dismiss my arguments. Look into it and realize that your children are smart enough and responsible enough to use AIM in an intelligent manner. And please, don't dismiss AIM as a useless program. As horrible as it seems, if you look at the benefits and compare them to the negatives, AIM can be the greatest ally to your children's social life and education.</p>
