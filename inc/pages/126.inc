<p>It started out a typical night, but the things that normally gave me comfort, such as my dad's loud snore and the clock's regular tick, faded away rapidly and gave way to the absolute silence that predates my worst nightmares. The dream began in a dark, lush forest. The treetops were too high to be visible. The plants on the ground were dense and hid many unknown creatures within their leaves. All around me the night animals made strange noises, so I began to seek refuge. But the moment I took a step forward, the ground opened up underneath me, and I fell into a deep hole. Upon landing, I found that the forest had disappeared, replaced instead by a jungle. It was after sunset, and all around me animal eyes glimmered from high treetops and from deep within bushes. The animals' unwavering stares unnerved me, and I attempted to frighten them with loud noise and rapid movement, but they only blinked, and did not move as I intended. Then, all of a sudden, I was charged by a roaring creature, and it swallowed me whole. When I finally opened my eyes, I found myself in a black cave, where even darker crevasses and tunnels opened on all sides. The noises from my footfalls, and from whatever pebbles I kicked as I walked, were amplified an echoed hundredfold by the smooth rock walls. Before I could acclimatize to the new environment, it disappeared again. I fell through countless caves, dungeons, and warehouses, each darker and murkier than the last, until I finally stopped in a long, endless hallway.</p>
<p>The ground was obscured in a smoky white haze, and the hall was lit dimly with candles which cast eerie wavering shadows onto the walls. Terrorized by thoughts of what unknown, horrifying creatures could be lurking in the tunnels, I tried to position myself such that I could watch all of the openings, but I could not complete this task. Whichever direction I turned, the tunnels were all equally dark and frightening, so I stepped into the first one, eager to escape my present condition, but the new passage had just as poor visibility. I began to walk down the corridor I had picked, in the hopes of finding an exit, when, after a few minutes, I heard a footstep behind me. I turned on the spot to catch a glimpse of my pursuer, but he was not to be seen in the shadowy atmosphere. Thinking it was merely an echo, I continued to progress down the hall, but when I heard the regular footsteps behind me yet again, I started searching in desperation for some way to escape them. I began to run, but in the intense dark I tripped once for every 5 strides I took. I turned left and right through doors, hallways, and rooms to evade my persistent pursuer, but he was not to be shaken. The pursuit ended when I mistakenly stepped through a doorway into a large room, and the enemy shut the door behind me. The thud of the falling bolt on the other side of the door made me jump in terror; now I was locked inside, and could not escape my fate.</p>
<p>I was now in a large circular room, lit similarly to the halls, with torches on the walls. The faint light revealed that the rooms had no walls, and that its entire circumference was a series of doors. The doors were of various shapes and sizes, each with a different carving and handle. I tried every one of the doors, but none would open. From behind the doors I could hear a cacophony of screaming, roaring, and scraping noise that grew louder every second. I tried to block out the noise but could not, and in a state of terror I sank down onto the dank concrete floor in the middle of the room. The noise stopped some minutes late when all of the doors opened with a bang, and a parade of shadows came marching out.</p>
<p>The small shadows emerged from the small doors, and the large ones from the large. Each shadow had a distinctive shape, but I could not identify it as a human or an object of any kind. The largest of the creatures picked me up in its icy grip and carried me through a door into a large dining hall. I was set down on the dining table. I shivered at every scrape of knife and fork being set down on the table. The shadows seemed to mock my predicament, jabbing at me with their utensils without regard for the pain I felt. When I couldn't take it any longer, I suddenly got up and leapt off of the table, hoping to escape. I braced myself for the impact with the ground, but it never came. Instead I kept falling.</p>
<p>The sensation of falling never ended, and I found that I had descended into a never ending blackness. There were no walls or floor. The space around me was too vast to comprehend, and I could not escape the blackness even by closing my eyes. This was my final destination. After passing through progressively darker worlds during my nightmare, I had ended up in this eternal blackness, unable to move, feel, or do anything to help my situation, so I screamed, having arrived into my worst nightmare.</p>
