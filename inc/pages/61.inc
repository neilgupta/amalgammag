<p>Crash: aka. The most OVERPRAISED piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune of watching.</p>

<p>Yes, I\'m talking about that movie that won the Oscar for best picture. Yes, I\'m talking about the movie that has a 76% fresh recommendation on Rotten Tomatoes. Yes, I\'m talking about the movie that is currently number 83 on IMDB\'s top 250 list. Yes, it\'s that movie with an ensemble cast about racism in LA. And yes, I\'m saying that this movie sucked.</p>

<p>Now you are all probably wondering, "Now why does this movie suck? Come on, Raymond. how can a movie with such a great message be so bad?"</p>

<p>Well, what message is this movie supposed to have? Is it that everybody is racist and stereotypical? What is so great about this message? And how does a message make for a good movie? If I wanted to watch a movie that had a great message, I\'d watch Barney. Message alone does not make for a good movie.</p>

<p>I\'m also pretty confused. What was the message? If it was something about everybody being racist, then I would think the writers undermined their own message by putting the locksmith character in the movie. So that can\'t be it. Tell me, what is the message of the movie?</p>

<p>The film opens with a Chinese woman rear ending a policewoman and then getting into an argument with her. The policewoman\'s partner then gets out of the car and investigates a murder. We then get a nice long flashback to the events preceding the murder, which explores the lives of a bunch of racist bigots and how they interact with one another. One of the first scenes involves 2 black men discussing racism in society. One of them says that white people are racist because whenever they see a black man, they assume he is a gangbanger and try to avoid him. Sandra Bullock then walks by, proving the man\'s point. This infuriates him so much that the two pull out guns and jack her car.</p>

<p>During this scene, I was wondering, "What the hell was the point of this? All that these men did was prove the point of view shared by many white Americans; all black people on the street are gangbangers."</p>

<p>Well, having finished the film, I concluded that the 2 black men were racist idiots, and throughout the movie, they remain racist idiots. The point of the scene was to show that while stereotypes can seem unfair and judgmental, they are usually true.</p>

<p>However, this theory is challenged many times in the movie. Sandra Bullock later accuses a man fixing the lock on her door of being a gangbanger because he has some tattoos. It turns out that he has recently moved out of a dangerous neighborhood so that his daughter can grow up safely. The locksmith and his daughter share the only good scene in the movie; after finding his daughter hiding under her bed after hearing what she thinks is a gunshot, the locksmith gives her an invisible, indestructible cloak that can protect her from anything, be it bullets or knives. Very rarely do directors put scenes like this into a movie. It helped give the movie a semblance of a heart, and it\'s too bad the writers didn\'t continue improving the movie after it.</p>

<p>What proceeds afterwards is a bunch of contrived, idiotic scenes. One involves a cop rescuing a woman he molested the night before from a burning car. Some people I know found this moving. I found it completely hilarious. The woman is stuck in a car leaking gasoline next to a car that\'s on fire, and the only thing she can say to the guy trying to save her is "GET AWAY FROM ME!!!" Had writers wanted me to take the scene seriously, the car would have blown up, killing both the cop and the woman. Unfortunately, the writers chickened out and let the cop save her.</p>

<p>Another incredibly dumb scene involves an immigrant shop owner, whose shop was vandalized after he refused to pay the locksmith. Infuriated that the insurance company won\'t pay for the damages, he tracks down the locksmith in order to make him pay the damages. The scene plays out horribly. The shop owner points a gun at the locksmith, ordering him to give him money. The locksmith\'s daughter stares out the door, realizing that the locksmith doesn\'t have the indestructible cloak. She then runs out and jumps right in front of her father just as the shop owner pulls the trigger. Sounds sad, right? Well, it turns out that the shop owner unwittingly loaded blanks into the gun, (IDIOT) so the girl doesn\'t die. Now I must admit, I didn\'t expect that to happen. I figured that the writers wouldn\'t be stupid and spoil a perfect opportunity to make a very emotional and unforgettable scene. But, the writers had to be stupid and family friendly. The movie would have been much better if the girl or locksmith had died. The locksmith was the only decent character, which would have made his death or his daughter\'s death more emotional. Unfortunately, we are left with this stupid scene.</p>

<p>Now, I have been told that the movie is a drama. As a drama, it fails miserably. The only way I can find the movie an acceptable form of entertainment is by saying it is so stupid that it\'s funny. You know, like Napoleon Dynamite. But alas, the movie was advertised as a drama, and the critics and public all believe this to be a drama, so I\'m going to have to critique this as a drama. And as a drama, it sucks. Now, notice I don\'t say it is overrated. Overrated means that the movie is good, but many people say it is better than it actually is. Crash, on the other hand, is quite simply a bad movie. Stupid situations and bad writing. How this crap won over Good Night and Good Luck or Munich I will never understand.</p>
