<p>The Edmonton Oilers are proving themselves to be the team to beat in the west in the NHL Playoffs this year, taking out the top-seeded Detroit Red Wings, and now taking a 3 games to 2 lead in a second-round series against the San Jose Sharks. They play a physical style, which bolsters their ability to score goals. This style enabled them to score a short-handed goal in the 5th game against the Sharks, the first game they won in San Jose. They are not afraid to take penalties, because San Jose cannot convert Power Plays into goals. In the east, the threat is the Carolina Hurricanes, who dispatched the New Jersey Devils 4 games to 1 in the second round. They will surely get to the Stanley Cup Finals. The short work they made of New Jersey, who themselves swept the Rangers in the first round, was reminiscent of their regular season, which was the best season in recent memory for the Hurricanes, and also probably the best season in franchise history. I believe that the Oilers will be taken to a game 7 by the Sharks, but will win again in San Jose to win the series. They will then win the conference finals 4 games to 1. The Finals for the Stanley Cup this year, in my opinion, will be 7 games, hotly disputed, and very physical, a grind-out style of play. The Carolina Hurricanes will emerge on top after the grueling series to put the crowning jewel in their best season.</p>
