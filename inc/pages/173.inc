<p>Love is often taken for granted in the world that we inhabit today. Often people boast that they are in love, yet they themselves do not completely comprehend what true love really is. Love is not the mere feeling of attachment to someone, but it is the passion, the pure poison that will capture your soul and breed on your very organs. When your love is being taken away from you, you will feel your blood being sucked out of you, a pain so throbbing that you will not feel the need to live anymore. Love will prosper and haunt you until <i>death</i> stands as an obstacle.</p>
<p>But my love is different. My love does not lead to <i>my</i> demise. My love freezes in time, so that even death has no control over it. My love is no one else\'s. My love is <i>mine</i>.</p>
<p>My days were filled with nothing but the thoughts of her arrival. Her return from work was what kept me going throughout the day. It was an endless cycle. But I felt differently today. Today, I was going to gain possession of something I had long awaited.</p>
<p>It was a Monday afternoon and I sat in my couch reading from a book the same line that I had been reading for the past seven months over and over again. The same, exact line: "The lily stay frozen in the rock forever, its beauty immortalized. The lily stay frozen in the rock forever, its beauty immortalized. The lily stay frozen in the rock forever, its beauty immortalized." And yet, the meaning had yet to reveal itself to me. It was a minute past five. She was late. She could not be late. My blood began to boil. Two past five. Finally, I heard a car pull over into the driveway next door. My heart began to pound rapidly. She had finally come home. I moved myself to the window and stood staring at her car, unable to see inside her high class Mercedes, the windows tinted. I stood motionless, waiting for her to open the door and slide her smooth, slender legs out of the car. After a whole minute of my waiting, the door finally opened. This time, however, it was not the same legs that I was accustomed to seeing for the past seven months. Stepping out was not my love, but another woman.</p>
<p>Confused and agitated, my hands began to tremble. Just as I was about to slam the book against the window in anger, I heard another door open, and it was then that I saw her step out. I began to calm down. Thank God she was home. The two began walking to her front door, laughing at some joke they had apparently found hilariously funny. My blood began to boil once again. That was the last straw. I could not bear to see her happy with someone else, regardless of who it was. If she were to be happy, it should only be with me.</p>
<p>There was something about her that brought life into me the minute I saw her, but every second that I was kept away from her beauty, a little part of me would die inside. I could not let this happen to me. I needed to be in control of my own life, and this is what I was going to do. I was going to take over my own life. My life included my love.</p>
<p>I rampaged through the kitchen, searching for the sharpest knife I had. Finally finding one, I stood in front of my window, waiting until her hideous friend left the house with the Mercedes. The monster had borrowed my beauty\'s car, and this meant that she would be back soon. I had little time to lose. I quickly made my way into the front porch, walking slowly towards her door. Finally reaching it after many elongated seconds, I reached for the doorbell and pressed it lightly. I could see a figure through the peephole. The door opened, and there stood the love of my life. This was the closest I had ever been to her. Her beauty was even more illuminated from up close. It was such a pity for me to be holding that knife behind my back. Such a beauty deserved to live. But that was not going to stop me. My life was more important, and I had to have her to myself.</p>
<p>She looked at me with a blank stare. "Do I know you?" she questioned. I stood there, not knowing what to say. "Excuse me! Do I <i>know</i> you?!" she asked again, this time in a slightly raised voice. I still didn\'t respond. "What do you want?!" she exclaimed. Tears filled my eyes.</p>
<p>"I want <i>you</i>," I whispered, bringing my knife to her heart and stabbing her heart over and over again without even giving her a chance to realize that she was being killed by a complete stranger for being too beautiful. She dropped to the floor and lay there motionless. My heart pounded faster and faster. She was finally mine. I looked at her beautiful body for a minute and then lifted her, carrying her over to my basement. I had not been down there in seven months. It reeked of a strange smell. I lay her on the table and took off her clothes, wiping the blood off her delicate body. I took out my scissors. Carefully cutting her sides with precision, I filled her insides with ice. Once done, I stitched her up again, and stood there looking at my priceless work of art. Finally, I was done. I was in control of my love. Her beauty would be immortalized, and no one other than me would have the liberty to look at her.</p>
<p>I carefully lifted her and set her on a hook on the wall of my gallery, next to the others. She was definitely the best of them. But I would not waste as much time on the next one, I decided. Seven months was much too long.</p>
