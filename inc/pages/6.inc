An increasing number of teens are being diagnosed as medically depressed, with the suicide rate climbing higher every year. As the number of those affected by depression raises, so does the controversy over whether medications help or make the conditions worse. </p><p>Many argue that the side effects caused by the medications - nausea, insomnia, headache, and agitation - are often misconstrued as depression being a side effect of depression itself. Resistance to taking medication also causes problems. When one starts off with too high a dose of the medication, stops taking it too soon, or doesn't believe that their condition is improving, serious side affects may occur, with the depression coming back full force. Often these medications have to be gradually stopped so that the body can readjust. </p><p>Psychiatrists specializing in pharmacology provide information often not exposed to the public. Medications are often prescribed at too high a level in the beginning, instead of starting out at a very low dose and slowly augmenting it. Sometimes the wrong medication is described by general practitioners, so the patient feels worse and not better. The most severe effects are when those with bipolar disorder are given anti-depressants, worsening their health seriously. Taking medication on a regular schedule is crucial, as otherwise it will not work properly. </p><p>If you are depressed or know someone who is and would like to start taking medication to improve their health, going to a specialist is highly recommended instead of just asking your normal doctor. High school counselors often can give you a number to call or you can get one through your regular physician. </p>";include ($Server_incRoot . 'authors/' . $aid . '.inc');?>
