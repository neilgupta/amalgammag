<p>In today\'s politically correct world, the line between racism and discrimination can be very thin. It appears that today, many Caucasians try to make amends to the African American population for past mistakes. Undoubtedly, the biggest mistake America has ever made was that of slavery. Within the past several years we have tried to make strides to help many minorities to prevent such discrimination from happening again. One result of this idea is affirmative action. According to Nancy Stein, editor of the progressive journal Crossroads and a member of the editorial board of Social Justice, affirmative action is "a policy to encourage equal opportunity and to level the playing field for groups of people who have been and are discriminated against" (1). But not everyone agrees with this policy. Roy Wilkins, a member of the NAACP, said "I have a problem with that whole concept. What you\'re asking for there is not equal treatment, but special treatment to make up for the unequal treatment of the past" (Canady 3).</p>
<p>Today, when a simple pronoun can be border line racism, one has to wonder when something is racist and when something is not. It has been well documented, and even made fun of in movies, that when a Caucasian would say "you people" to an African American, it is assumed that he is undoubtedly racist. But when you have two equally qualified college applicants, and you choose one over the other based solely on the color of his skin, this is deemed acceptable. Why? Charles T. Canady, a Republican representative from Florida, says that the Jim Crow laws violated the fundamental American idea that says "all men are created equal" (2). But if colleges favor minorities over Caucasians, then doesn\'t this mean that affirmative action could be considered modern day Jim Crow laws? This affirmative action just creates reverse racism. Bill Conti and Brad Stetson, two writers for a black political opinion and culture magazine, say, "Many blacks are now wondering if the gaudy rhetoric necessary to sustain an affirmative action culture is worth the moral price paid by blacks, especially youth, who become so sensitive to the \'racism\' of others that they fail to see it in themselves" (3). In 1970 the U.S. Dept of Labor issued an order saying that certain government programs must include "goals and timetables to which the contractor\'s good faith efforts must be directed to correct ... deficiencies" (Canady 4). My question is, since when did the government gain the power to say what is deficient and what is not? There are many, though, who support affirmative action. Teachers at Desmet Jesuit High School argue that many Africans do not have the same resources as Caucasians, and therefore won\'t be able to have a fair advantage to get into better high schools and to achieve good standardized test scores. I have two problems with this; one is that there are many Africans who have good grades even though they have fewer resources than many whites, and another is that if blacks are being held in higher regard due to their lack of financial resources, wouldn\'t it make more sense to not give an advantage based on color, but instead on financial resources? William Mellor, a member of the libertarian Institute for Justice, says that affirmative action helps educated middle income minorities instead of lower class minorities whom it was truly intended to help. He writes, "It helps those who need it the least. For those in the inner city it\'s at best useless and at worst creates a climate of hostility from other workers" (Billingsley 2). Gerald Reynolds, an attorney and a senior fellow at the Center for New Black Leadership in Washington D.C., says that racism and discrimination is no longer the reason why Africans cannot succeed, but instead "factors such as crime, substandard academic performance, and out-of-wedlock births - stands (sic) in the way of progress" (2). Another argument in favor of affirmative action is that it creates diversity. Chang-Lin Tien, a former chancellor of the University of California in Berkeley, is an avid supporter of affirmative action. He says that affirmative action creates diversity and promotes racial tolerance. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, many students at the University of Michigan tended to make close friends with students of their own race (Hentoff 2). He thinks that outside of Berkeley, if you have an Asian, Latino, or Middle Eastern features or surname, many Caucasians assume you were born in another country (2). This is a narrow view of the outside world. He also states in his article titled "Attacking the Problem" that it is crucial that we attack "the problem of racial division and build on national strengths. The finest hope for meeting this challenge will be America\'s colleges and universities" (2). My very strong and passionate response is, that this is true. We need to combat racial division, but how effective is it when we battle racial division with more racial division?</p>
<p>Although being a minority gives me an advantage in applying for college, I would rather not take the place of a more deserving peer due to my race. Nat Hentoff, who is a writer for the Village Voice, provides a very interesting question: what is race? "...is a student more \'diverse\' if she has one white parent and one Latino parent, or less \'diverse\'? What if she has three white grandparents and one Asian grandparent? In awarding preferences, which drop of blood counts?" (3). Other than the moral concerns, I feel that it is not fair to the person I am superseding; he or she did not choose to be in the majority, and I did not choose to be in the minority. I, like many other minorities, feel that we should be judged upon our accomplishments and our service to our schools and communities. We do not want to go to school and have people look at us and tell us that the only reason we are there is because of affirmative action. It is degrading that people think we need to have a lowered bar to be able to make it. One way to solve the problem of affirmative action is to replace the race category with a financial category. Another solution, which is the simplest: to just get rid of the race question on the application all together. Is race really so important that we need to ask? One question that might arise would be if we don\'t ask about race, won\'t most of our campuses be mostly white? Roger Clegg, vice president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, says that it will hurt some and help some of the minority groups (3). He also says that "minorities who no longer get into one school because of its color-blind policies will still be able to get into other schools - where their qualifications and graduation rates will now be on par with the rest of the student body" (Clegg 3). And without preference, any drop in minority admissions will just show how much preferences was being used and the degree to which those minorities were not prepared to compete in that institution (Clegg 3).</p>
<p>I hope that I have enough credentials to make it into your fine institution. I know that with an excellent education provided by SLU I can make a difference in the world and in my community. I also hope that I make SLU based on my qualifications and not on the color of my skin or to meet a quota. Even though affirmative action will help me gain admission into some colleges, I still believe it to be racist and unfair and I hope that you will look at all applicants based on their qualifications. Lastly, I hope to see you all in the fall on my way to class.</p>
