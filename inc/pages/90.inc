<p>My footsteps resounded only in my panic-stricken mind as I pounded down a deserted street filled with swirling mists and a thick fog, the consistency of mortar. Heart thudding from wild agony like that of a frightened animal spurred on by instinct to flee, I barely glanced behind my shoulder as I tore my way through the nearly solid tendrils of gray haze that obstructed my vision. The street lamps were dimmed; the moon failed to make its appearance in a starless sky. Though the entire earth seemed cast in a black shadow, a pervasive, blurred light allowed me to see only a few steps at a time. I knew no life before this, only this obscure realm of dark vapors; thoughts of the future were irrelevant until I could exit this mad present.</p>
<p>Had I turned around to face what pursued me, I knew I would be paralyzed by fear. My only realization was an unspeakable danger trailed behind, heralding a symphony of death to my loved ones, violence to my neighborhood, and a scourging plague upon innocents before my very eyes. As long as the pernicious nature of this unknown identity was clear, I had no desire to see the face of this attacker, nor the embodiment of this horror if it were not human. Already, panic spoke from the drops of clammy perspiration on my forehead and the violent trembling in my limbs. But with the unearthly strength that enables mothers to lift fallen trees off their trapped children, I pressed on without a trace of fatigue, fueled by the same terrible urgency that nature lends us in pressing times.</p>
<p><i>If only, if only</i>! If I could just elude the cold grasp of what followed! The lights burning distantly offered refuge, but <i>oh, if only I could get there</i>!</p>
<p>If my legs could carry me faster than evil could lay hands upon me and deliver me into the haven I knew lay ahead, calamity could be averted. All the fates of those dear to me, as well as my own peace of mind, rested in my ability to escape; despite my alarm, I steeled myself against the unknown danger. When pitted against any enemy, I knew my greatest advantage would be in strategic flight - my faith in my own velocity was unquenchable. When the moment arises, I reasoned that sheer will power could make up any lack of physical ability; as long as I willed myself to run faster, safety would become certainty. Nevertheless, that festering worm named Doubt, which gnawed steadily in the back of my mind, spawned fear even as I attempted, running through heavy, enveloping mists, to summon confidence. Accompanied by the now-irregular beating of my heart, Doubt's traitorous whispers echoed throughout the empty avenue till I was certain even my pursuer, not far behind, heard.</p>
<p><i>What if, what if, what if,</i> chanted my footsteps, their tuneless pattern now resonating in a treacherous song. Yes, I interrupted my mental automation to wonder, <i>what if</i>? Could that be possible? The question, now fully formed, rose above all other thoughts, blossoming into a great bubble and then finally bursting.</p>
<p>For the first time, much to my dismay, my gait slowed. My limbs cramped with the miles of hard running and my lungs gasped for air, but more impeding than these minor physical discomforts was the sudden leaden sensation in my legs. While I could still move my legs and maintain the length of each stride, my pace reduced to slow-motion. Such a sensation was comparable to an underwater race, when a sprinter's movements, though same as her muscle usage and step on land, produce only half the speed and twice the frustration. No matter how much I might exert myself or hurl myself forward in a vain attempt to gain speed, my legs would only move in halftime, as if running through an invisible gel. Straining at the pressure pushing contrary to my direction, I felt a jolt of unadulterated terror run through my body as I fought my way toward a dim hope of safety. Every inch of ground I gained, bought at the price of enormous physical strain and too much time, seemed to me a futile gesture - could I hope to reach my distant refuge knowing that my hunter advanced steadily behind? Every step upon the ground created an excruciatingly slow drum beat, slower than my heart rate, so unbearably measured that I bit my tongue in frustration till the salty-sweet taste of blood and bile's sweet bitterness filled my mouth.</p>
<p><i>Why can't I go faster? There are no injuries impairing my legs, and the ground is the same, so why am I suddenly so unendurably sluggish?</i> These thoughts raged inside, as I, plagued by agonizing frustration, forged uselessly onward at the plodding pace of the elderly and the crippled. Filled with a bursting despair and bafflement at my incapacitation, I now understood how entrapment, really a guise of helplessness, could drive people to claw at their own skin till it drew blood, to tear out their hair, and rend their own clothes. Maddening as it was to continue slogging down an eerie road through chilly vapors at this trudging pace, the situation was even more trying when compounded by awareness that I teetered on the cusp of imminent danger.</p>
<p>As I was straining at my imaginary chains, the looming forerunner of death and destruction had considerably bridged the gap between us until the distance was less than a few paces. Its ominous presence, just a few lengths away, broke the stifling hush of the ghostly nighttime by unleashing another coursing wave of fear through my veins. Only rather than the familiar rush of pulsating adrenaline, fear was a numbing layer of ice over my bloodstream - and possibly my heart and mind. Again, I willed myself to quicken my pace but, alas, no matter how I pushed myself, my speed persisted in its consistency, even in the very face of dire necessity. The rendering of all my ability useless, in my greatest time of need, was as confusing as any betrayal - impossible to fathom what transpired.</p>
<p><i>All I know now</i>, I grasped at desperately, <i>is that I might as well stop running. I once thought I could escape and I couldn't, so this is the end of it all.</i> My battered spirit had run into one too many walls, solid for all their mist and stronger than my ability to overcome. I was about to be consumed by a ghastly evil that would wreak havoc upon all that I held dear, and worst of all, I was absolutely stripped of all options to escape this impending fate.</p>
<p>Wearied by my futile efforts and utter despair, I looked ahead to see the hazy, distant glow of safety before it vanished behind a sweeping veil of murkiness. Blood and bile mingled together, creating the final flavor of my complete powerlessness and indescribable dread.</p>
