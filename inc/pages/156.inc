<p>I\'m a PC user, and a big part of being a PC user is backing up your files. I don\'t imagine that quite as many users expose their computers to as many security risks as I do, but I often find that many people actually have more malware on their computer than I do. A big part of this is being careful on the web, as there are tons of websites ready to exploit your stupidity in using Internet Explorer instead of Firefox. However, eventually, the inevitable happens, and your computer is compromised. All of a sudden, you\'re getting applications you didn\'t install, slower computer performance, and pop-ups of a nature we don\'t want to talk about here. As well as getting pummeled by spyware-creating hackers, your computer may also undergo physical damage, such as being heaved from the second story of a building, being dropped, or even being held in a crushing headlock by an evil teacher. </p>
<p>Like most PC users, I have contracted quite a bit of spyware over the years. Unfortunately, contracting spyware is an inevitable part of being a PC user, so other than being careful, there is really nothing you can do about it. The problem is, what do you do when you do contract spyware? Let\'s make the situation more complicated. What if your computer becomes so infected with malware that you\'re unable to run the OS (with a reasonable amount of speed) anymore? On top of that, let\'s say that a combination of Spybot and Ad-aware is not able to fix up your system. This is a point at which there is nothing to do except reformat the computer and re-install the OS.</p> 
<p>With Windows, this is achieved by booting from the Windows installation CD. You are taken through a series of steps where you can reformat the computer and re-install Windows. This, of course, is a pretty tedious process where you will have to sit in front of the computer for an hour or more pressing buttons systematically during the Windows installation. Luckily, you backed up all of your important files, but then, there is the problem of re-installing all of your applications, which takes another 3 hours to download and install. Then, there are the settings for your carefully customized OS that you have to re-set all over again. All of this can be taxing for some simple data recovery. </p>
<p>This is where Norton Ghost comes in. Norton Ghost is a backup utility that can help the average PC user achieve complete invincibility against malware altogether. One of the most useful features of Norton Ghost is its ability to create an image of your hard drive. This image can be used to restore your computer to exactly the state it was in when the image was taken. This means restoring your computer to its pure, spyware-free state with all of the applications installed <i>and</i> all of your settings exactly the way you like them in under 30 minutes. (The last time I had to do this, it took 6 minutes and 43 seconds.) This, of course, also means you can do <i>anything</i> to your computer (besides abuse it physically) without fear of there being permanent damage to it, since you can restore it to an earlier state using the hard drive image. In the case that your hard drive <i>is</i> damaged, you can replace the hard drive without fear of losing valuable data.</p>
<p>One of the best things about Norton Ghost is that you can schedule automatic backups (daily, weekly, or monthly). This takes the tedium out of manually backing up your files by dragging them to a backup server or external hard drive. However, you don\'t have to use Norton Ghost to restore your entire hard drive. You can also restore individual files or folders from the backup image. This is useful when you\'ve accidentally deleted a file. You remember that Norton Ghost backed up your hard drive last night though, so you can use Norton Ghost\'s backup image browser and restore the file.</p>
<p>Norton Ghost is a very simple utility, but its usefulness is beyond question. With its automatic backups and hard drive images, it can make your life a lot easier and give you peace of mind when trying out that dubious piece of software that you downloaded the other night from some P2P network, knowing that if anything goes wrong, you can restore the computer to its clean, working status.</p>
