<p>The sound of lead on paper from twenty mechanical pencils filled the room as twenty little souls hurriedly tried to finish their Redemption Exams before the call of a nightingale, marking the end of the time allowed. Redemption Exams were a series of one hundred multiple choice questions that surveyed children about their acts of both kindness and corruption throughout their lifetime, ultimately determining their overall purity. A particularly hardworking and persistent girl named Jessica, whose acts portrayed the epitome of morality, was sitting at a desk among these students, putting all her effort into a test that would contribute to a final decision made by God about her final destination: Heaven or Purgatory. As the delicate music of the nightingale echoed in the distance, the guardian angel announced, \"Time is now up. Your scores will be sent to your Morality Counselors shortly.\" Jessica felt a shiver of excitement combined with anxiety as she rushed to her counselor to receive her results.</p>
<p>During the last years of her life, Jessica had been assigned as a pupil to Mr. Satin, a short stout man who always refused to remove his hat and long trenchcoat, famous for his successful work in inducting the greatest number of angels for heaven. Sitting nervously in front of his desk, Jessica's hands grew clammy as she watched Mr. Satin's shifty eyes fly across her Heaven application while checking her Redemption Exam scores. Having dedicated the past four years to serving the community, Jessica desired nothing more than to earn herself a spot in Heaven, as all prospective applicants are judged upon three aspects: honorable deeds performed throughout their lifetime, levels of purity, and application essays. After a long, eerie silence, Mr. Satin's eyes finally came to a rest from thorough scanning. He looked up and revealed, \"Although your purity level is exceptionally admirable, it seems that your honorable deeds are inappropriate; you have focused more on the quality of your actions rather than the quantity, which is unacceptable based upon my standards.\"</p>
<p>Jessica was speechless and stared back at her counselor with a puzzled expression, for she had been commended by others for her many hours of service at church in addition to her charity work. Hearing her counselor utter such words of disapproval tore through her perseverance as well as her confidence.</p>
<p>\"What do you propose I should include in my list?\" she meekly inquired.</p>
<p>\"Focus more on the basics rather than the meaningful deeds such as showing children the way to the bathroom, or supporting the beggars on the streets by giving them a dime. With these acts accumulated, I have no doubt that you will be on your way to Hell. I mean Heaven, pardon me.\"</p>
<p>Jessica raised an eyebrow as Mr. Satin stifled a cough. However, her innocence overcame suspicion; she placed all her trust in her Morality counselor, and proceeded to do the moral deeds that were suggested in the little amount of time that she had left before the application deadline.</p>
<p>After spending the entirety of her afternoon giving children directions to the bathroom and donating countless dimes to various beggars, Jessica felt satisfied with her moral actions and returned home to start the essay portion of her application. <i>\"In your opinion, out of all the honorable deeds you have completed, which action would appeal to Heaven the most?\"</i> Immediately reminiscing about the last year of her life that she spent in Darfur cooking for the homeless and fighting against genocide, Jessica decided that Heaven could not reject her, knowing that she sacrificed her own life to improve those of others in need, so she began to write. After meticulous polishing, she eagerly emailed a copy of her fifty-page essay to Mr. Satin, confident that he would approve. Almost instantly, her phone rang, and her infuriated Morality Counselor bellowed, \"Why did you write about such a dramatic experience! Heaven is not interested in accepting distinguished souls; rather, they prefer the typical ones. What did you do this afternoon?\"</p>
<p>\"Well... I followed your advice and lead all the children to the bathrooms,\" Jessica stammered.</p>
<p>\"Excellent. That manifests your contribution to the happiness of adolescents. Rewrite everything, and be sure to submit your application no earlier than 11:59 PM tomorrow.\" Mr. Satin demanded.</p>
<p>\"But Mr. Satin, I thought the deadline was tomorrow before 11:59 PM?\" Jessica inquired, but was not answered, for she could hear a light cough and the sound of the other line being disconnected.</p>
<p>Sitting down at her desk once again to restart her essay, Jessica completed her revised essay on how beneficial her honorable deed of showing little boys and girls to the bathroom was. Having finished within an hour, she spent the rest of the time left before her submission deadline shopping for a new pair of wings so as to fly into heaven, confident that her Morality Counselor's advice had guaranteed her acceptance. At exactly 12:00 AM, Jessica sealed her entire application into an envelope, tied it to a messenger bird, and watched her future being carried away for God to determine. She was quite satisfied with her accomplishment and eagerly awaited the next day, the day her fate would be decided and brought back to her.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the sound of flapping wings and seeing the first light of dawn, Jessica awoke and knew that her mail had just been delivered. She happily ran to her mailbox and flung open the door, expecting a large envelope that would contain her acceptance letter into Heaven. However, instead of excitement and exhilaration when she beheld her envelope, Jessica's face embodied a gaunt expression; to her horror, a small envelope confirming her rejection was sitting in the palm of her hand. \"No... there has to be a mistake!\" she insisted, in denial. As quickly as she had let her words escape, a cloud of black smoke appeared around Jessica, eventually congealing into solid and binding her so taut that she could not move. As she struggled against the restraints around her limbs, sadistic laughter vibrated through her ears as her Morality Counselor suddenly appeared, this time without his hat and trenchcoat, revealing a pair of bright red horns and a sharp tail. His eyes no longer gleamed with an effervescent glow, but now sizzled with malevolence. Jessica felt the firmness of the pavement beneath her debilitating as she sank deeper past the various layers of Earth, feeling warmer as she descended, seeing nothing but darkness, and hearing nothing but the echoing laughter of Mr. Satin.</p>
