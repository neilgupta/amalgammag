<p>Life has its mysteries and unexpected turns, but at times one\'s manner of existence can be completely reversed, especially in the event of an epiphany. This is an aspect of life that adds to the diversity of life\'s conclusions. Just when one believes he is certain of his monotonous lifestyle\'s permanency, he experiences what could just be a moment of seeing an image in front of him, thus changing his entire perception of his existence. An epiphany could strike in anyone\'s life; Mahatma Ghandi was originally a lawyer in South Africa until he was thrown out of a train for sitting in a Whites-only compartment during the days of apartheid. After that day Ghandi became a spiritual leader for equality, and later an advocate of Indian independence. But an epiphany can occur in a life such as mine, as it did prior to writing this paper. My moment of revelation occurred, while I was thinking about an epiphany I would write about. As it came to me I came in into a state of enlightenment and awe. I realized that I have not had any major epiphanies in my life (with the exception of my birth, which I have no substantial recollection of). It was ironic, but it was an epiphany in every sense of the word. I realized a truth and I under went a characteristic change; I became more adventurous and risk-taking, for example writing my paper on this particular epiphany. I hope to experience as many epiphanies as possible to live through different types of lifestyles. Life is short as it is, so might as well see it fully. Some would say that my momentous occurrence of change is not an epiphany at all, but a lousy attempt to escape this assignment, but I would say it all depended on the epiphanies my audience would have, since that facilitates their differing perception of life.</p>
